> The finest NBA CLI.

Watch NBA live play-by-play, game preview, box score and player information on your console.  
Best CLI tool for those who are both **NBA fans** and **Engineers**.

All data comes from [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/) APIs.

## Install

In order to use nba-go, make sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) version 6.0.0 or higher.

```
$ npm install -g nba-go
```

Or in a Docker Container:

```
$ docker build -t nba-go:latest .
$ docker run -it nba-go:latest
```

By default, the docker container will run `nba-go game -t`, but you can
override this command at run time.  
For example:

```
$ docker run -it nba-go:latest nba-go player Curry -i
```

Or download the latest version [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) binaries in [releases](https://github.com/xxhomey19/nba-go/releases). It can be run on Linux, macOs and Windows.  
For example:

```
./nba-go-macos game -h
```

## Usage

`nba-go` provides two main commands.

1. [`game` or `g`](#game)
2. [`player` or `p`](#player)

### Game

There are two things to do.

1. [**Check schedule**](#check-schedule).
2. Choose one game which you want to watch.

Depending on the status of the game you chose, a different result will be shown. There are three kinds of statuses that may be displayed.

| Status              | Example                                                                                                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                             |

# :chicken::chicken::chicken:JetPackMvvm
- **基于MVVM模式集成谷歌官方推荐的JetPack组件库：LiveData、ViewModel、Lifecycle、Navigation组件**
- **使用kotlin语言，添加大量拓展函数，简化代码**
- **加入Retrofit网络请求,协程，帮你简化各种操作，让你快速请求网络**  

## 演示Demo
 已用该库重构了我之前的玩安卓项目，利用Navigation组件以单Activity+Fragment架构编写，优化了很多代码，对比之前的mvp项目，开发效率与舒适度要提高了不少，想看之前MVP的项目可以去 [https://github.com/hegaojian/WanAndroid](https://github.com/hegaojian/WanAndroid)

## 1.如何集成

- **1.1 在root's build.gradle中加入Jitpack仓库**

``` gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

- **1.2 在app's build.gradle中添加依赖**

``` gradle
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.hegaojian:JetpackMvvm:1.2.7'
}
```

- **1.3 在app's build.gradle中，android 模块下按需开启DataBinding与ViewBinding**

``` gradle
AndroidStudio 4.0 以下版本------>
android {
    ...
    dataBinding {
        enabled = true 
    }
    viewBinding {
        enabled = true
    }
}

AndroidStudio 4.0及以上版本 ------>
android {
    ...
   buildFeatures {
        dataBinding = true
        viewBinding = true
    }
}
 
```

## 2.继承基类
一般我们项目中都会有一套自己定义的符合业务需求的基类 ***BaseActivity/BaseFragment***，所以我们的基类需要**继承本框架的Base类**

- 不想用Databinding与ViewBinding-------可以继承 BaseVmActivity/BaseVmFragment
- 用Databinding-----------可以继承BaseVmDbActivity/BaseVmDbFragment**
- 用Viewbinding-----------可以继承BaseVmVbActivity/BaseVmVbFragment**

**Activity：**

``` kotlin 
abstract class BaseActivity<VM : BaseViewModel, DB : ViewDataBinding> : BaseVmDbActivity<VM, DB>() {
     /**
     * 当前Activity绑定的视图布局Id abstract修饰供子类实现
     */
    abstract override fun layoutId(): Int
    /**
     * 当前Activityc创建后调用的方法 abstract修饰供子类实现
     */
    abstract override fun initView(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)

    /**
     * 创建liveData数据观察
     */
    override override fun createObserver()


    /**
     * 打开等待框 在这里实现你的等待框展示
     */
    override fun showLoading(message: String) {
       ...
    }

    /**
     * 关闭等待框 在这里实现你的等待框关闭
     */
    override fun dismissLoading() {
       ...
    }
}
```
**Fragment：**
``` kotlin
abstract class BaseFragment<VM : BaseViewModel,DB:ViewDataBinding> : BaseVmDbFragment<VM,DB>() {
   
    abstract override fun initView(savedInstanceState: Bundle?)

    /**
     * 懒加载 只有当前fragment视图显示时才会触发该方法 abstract修饰供子类实现
     */
    abstract override fun lazyLoadData()

    /**
     * 创建liveData数据观察 懒加载之后才会触发
     */
    override override fun createObserver()
  
    /**
     * Fragment执行onViewCreated后触发的方法 
     */
    override fun initData() {

    }
    
   /**
     * 打开等待框 在这里实现你的等待框展示
     */
    override fun showLoading(message: String) {
       ...
    }

    /**
     * 关闭等待框 在这里实现你的等待框关闭
     */
    override fun dismissLoading() {
       ...
    }
}
```

## 3.编写一个登录功能

- **3.1 创建LoginViewModel类继承BaseViewModel**

``` xml
class LoginViewModel : BaseViewModel() {
  
}
```

- **3.2 创建LoginFragment 继承基类传入相关泛型,第一个泛型为你创建的LoginViewModel,第二个泛型为ViewDataBind，保存fragment_login.xml后databinding会生成一个FragmentLoginBinding类。（如果没有生成，试着点击Build->Clean Project）**
``` kotlin
class LoginFragment : BaseFragment<LoginViewModel, FragmentLoginBinding>() {
    
    /**
     *  初始化操作
     */
    override fun initView(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
    }
    
    /**
     *  fragment 懒加载
     */
    override fun lazyLoadData() { 
        ...
    }
}
```

## 4.网络请求（Retrofit+协程）

- **4.1 新建请求配置类继承 BaseNetworkApi 示例：**
``` kotlin
class NetworkApi : BaseNetworkApi() {

   companion object {
         
        val instance: NetworkApi by lazy(mode = LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED) { NetworkApi() }

        //双重校验锁式-单例 封装NetApiService 方便直接快速调用
        val service: ApiService by lazy(mode = LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED) {
            instance.getApi(ApiService::class.java, ApiService.SERVER_URL)
        }
    }
   
    /**
     * 实现重写父类的setHttpClientBuilder方法，
     * 在这里可以添加拦截器，可以对 OkHttpClient.Builder 做任意你想要做的骚操作
     */
    override fun setHttpClientBuilder(builder: OkHttpClient.Builder): OkHttpClient.Builder {
        builder.apply {
            //示例：添加公共heads，可以存放token，公共参数等， 注意要设置在日志拦截器之前，不然Log中会不显示head信息
            addInterceptor(MyHeadInterceptor())
            // 日志拦截器
            addInterceptor(LogInterceptor())
            //超时时间 连接、读、写
            connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            readTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            writeTimeout(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        }
        return builder
    }

    /**
     * 实现重写父类的setRetrofitBuilder方法，
     * 在这里可以对Retrofit.Builder做任意骚操作，比如添加GSON解析器，protobuf等
     */
    override fun setRetrofitBuilder(builder: Retrofit.Builder): Retrofit.Builder {
        return builder.apply {
            addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create(GsonBuilder().create()))
            addCallAdapterFactory(CoroutineCallAdapterFactory())
        }
    }
}
```


- **4.2如果你请求服务器返回的数据有基类（没有可忽略这一步）例如:**
``` kotlin
{
    ""data"": ...,
    ""errorCode"": 0,
    ""errorMsg"": """"
}
```
该示例格式是 [玩Android Api](https://www.wanandroid.com/blog/show/2)返回的数据格式，如果errorCode等于0 请求成功，否则请求失败
作为开发者的角度来说，我们主要是想得到脱壳数据-data，且不想每次都判断errorCode==0请求是否成功或失败
这时我们可以在服务器返回数据基类中继承BaseResponse，实现相关方法：

``` kotlin
data class ApiResponse<T>(var errorCode: Int, var errorMsg: String, var data: T) : BaseResponse<T>() {

    // 这里是示例，wanandroid 网站返回的 错误码为 0 就代表请求成功，请你根据自己的业务需求来编写
    override fun isSucces() = errorCode == 0

    override fun getResponseCode() = errorCode

    override fun getResponseData() = data

    override fun getResponseMsg() = errorMsg

}
```
- **4.3 在ViewModel中发起请求，所有请求都是在viewModelScope中启动，请求会发生在IO线程，最终回调在主线程上，当页面销毁的时候，请求会统一取消，不用担心内存泄露的风险，框架做了2种请求使用方式**  

**1、将请求数据包装给ResultState，在Activity/Fragment中去监听ResultState拿到数据做处理**

``` kotlin
class RequestLoginViewModel: BaseViewModel {

  //自动脱壳过滤处理请求结果，自动判断结果是否成功
    var loginResult = MutableLiveData<ResultState<UserInfo>>()
    
  //不用框架帮脱壳
    var loginResult2 = MutableLiveData<ResultState<ApiResponse<UserInfo>>>()
    
  fun login(username: String, password: String){
   //1.在 Activity/Fragment的监听回调中拿到已脱壳的数据（项目有基类的可以用）
        request(
            { HttpRequestCoroutine.login(username, password) }, //请求体
            loginResult,//请求的结果接收者，请求成功与否都会改变该值，在Activity或fragment中监听回调结果，具体可看loginActivity中的回调
            true,//是否显示等待框，，默认false不显示 可以默认不传
            ""正在登录中...""//等待框内容，可以默认不填请求网络中...
        )
        
   //2.在Activity/Fragment中的监听拿到未脱壳的数据，你可以自己根据code做业务需求操作（项目没有基类的可以用）
        requestNoCheck(
          {HttpRequestCoroutine.login(username,password)},
          loginResult2,
          true,
          ""正在登录中..."") 
}


class LoginFragment : BaseFragment<LoginViewModel, FragmentLoginBinding>() {
    
    private val requestLoginRegisterViewModel: RequestLoginRegisterViewModel by viewModels()
    
    /**
     *  初始化操作
     */
    override fun initView(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
    }
    
    /**
     *  fragment 懒加载
     */
    override fun lazyLoadData() { 
        ...
    }
    
    override fun createObserver(){
      //脱壳
       requestLoginRegisterViewModel.loginResult.observe(viewLifecycleOwner,
            Observer { resultState ->
                parseState(resultState, {
                    //登录成功 打印用户
                    it.username.logd()
                }, {
                    //登录失败(网络连接问题，服务器的结果码不正确...异常都会走在这里)
                    showMessage(it.errorMsg)
                })
            })
    
       //不脱壳
       requestLoginRegisterViewModel.loginResult2.observe(viewLifecycleOwner, Observer {resultState ->
               parseState(resultState,{
                   if(it.errorCode==0){
                       //登录成功 打印用户名
                       it.data.username.logd()
                   }else{
                       //登录失败
                       showMessage(it.errorMsg)
                   }
               },{
                   //请求发生了异常
                   showMessage(it.errorMsg)
               })
           })
   } 
}
```

**2、 直接在当前ViewModel中拿到请求结果**

``` kotlin
class RequestLoginViewModel : BaseViewModel() {
    
  fun login(username: String, password: String){
   //1.拿到已脱壳的数据（项目有基类的可以用）
     request({HttpRequestCoroutine.login(username,password)},{
             //请求成功 已自动处理了 请求结果是否正常
             it.username.logd()
         },{
             //请求失败 网络异常，或者请求结果码错误都会回调在这里
             it.errorMsg.logd()
         },true,""正在登录中..."")
        
   //2.拿到未脱壳的数据，你可以自己根据code做业务需求操作（项目没有基类或者不想框架帮忙脱壳的可以用）
       requestNoCheck({HttpRequestCoroutine.login(username,password)},{
            //请求成功 自己拿到数据做业务需求操作
            if(it.errorCode==0){
                //结果正确
                it.data.username.logd()
            }else{
                //结果错误
                it.errorMsg.logd()
            }
        },{
            //请求失败 网络异常回调在这里
            it.errorMsg.logd()
        },true,""正在登录中..."")
}
 
```
### 注意：使用该请求方式时需要注意，如果该ViewModel并不是跟Activity/Fragment绑定的泛型ViewModel，而是
val mainViewModel:MainViewModel by viewModels()
或者
val mainViewModel：MainViewModel by activityViewModels()
获取的
如果请求时要弹出loading，你需要在Activity | Fragment中添加以下代码：
### addLoadingObserve(viewModel)

## 4.4 开启打印日志开关
设置全局jetpackMvvmLog变量 是否打开请求日志，默认false不打印，如需要打印日志功能，请设值为 true

## 5.获取ViewModel
- **5.1我们的activity/fragment会有多个ViewModel，按传统的写法感觉有点累**
``` kotlin
 val mainViewModel = ViewModelProvider(this,
            ViewModelProvider.AndroidViewModelFactory(application)).get(MainViewModel::class.java)
```
**现在官方Ktx有拓展函数可以轻松调用
``` kotlin
//在activity中获取当前Activity级别作用域的ViewModel
 private val mainViewModel:MainViewModel by viewModels()
 
//在activity中获取Application级别作用域的ViewModel（注，这个是本框架提供的，Application类继承框架的BaseApp才有用）
 private val mainViewModel by lazy { getAppViewModel<MainViewModel>()}

//在fragment中获取当前Fragment级别作用域的ViewModel
 private val mainViewModel:MainViewModel by viewModels()

//在fragment中获取父类Activity级别作用域的ViewModel
private val mainViewModel：MainViewModel by activityViewModels()

//在fragment中获取Application级别作用域的ViewModel（注，这个是本框架提供的，Application类继承框架的BaseApp才有用）
private val mainViewModel by lazy { getAppViewModel<MainViewModel>()}
```
## 6.写了一些常用的拓展函数
``` kotlin
 算了不写了，这个不重要，想具体看的话可以在
 me.hgj.jetpackmvvm.ext.util
 me.hgj.jetpackmvvm.ext.view
 的包中看，反正你也可以自己写，按照自己的喜好与需求来
```

## 7.混淆

``` kotlin 
-keep class me.hgj.jetpackmvvm.**{*;}
################ ViewBinding & DataBinding ###############
-keepclassmembers class * implements androidx.viewbinding.ViewBinding {
  public static * inflate(android.view.LayoutInflater);
  public static * inflate(android.view.LayoutInflater, android.view.ViewGroup, boolean);
  public static * bind(android.view.View);
}
```

> 🏀 Analyze basketball shots and shooting pose with machine learning!

This is an artificial intelligence application built on the concept of **object detection**. Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection. We can get the result by simply uploading files to the web App, or submitting a **POST request** to the API. Please check the [features](#features) below. There are more features coming up! Feel free to follow.

All the data for the shooting pose analysis is calculated by implementing [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). Please note that this is an implementation only for noncommercial research use only. Please read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/chonyy/AI-basketball-analysis/blob/master/LICENSE), which is exaclty same as the [CMU's OpenPose License](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/LICENSE).

If your are interested in the concept of human pose estimation, I have written a [research paper **summary**](https://towardsdatascience.com/openpose-research-paper-summary-realtime-multi-person-2d-pose-estimation-3563a4d7e66) of OpenPose. Check it out!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Get a copy

Get a copy of this project by simply running the git clone command.

``` git
git clone https://github.com/chonyy/AI-basketball-analysis.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, we have to install all the dependencies from requirements.txt

``` pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please note that you need a GPU with proper CUDA setup to run the video analysis, since a CUDA device is required to run OpenPose.

### Hosting

Last, get the project hosted on your local machine with a single command.

``` python
python app.py
```

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/index_page.PNG"" width=""551.1"" height=""278.7"">
</p>

#### Alternatives

##### Google Colab

[<img src=""https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg"" align=""center"">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hardik0/AI-basketball-analysis-on-google-colab/blob/master/AI_basketball_analysis_google_colab.ipynb)

Thanks to [hardik0](https://github.com/hardik0/AI-basketball-analysis-on-google-colab). Now we can play around with it without a GPU machine!

##### Heroku

This project is also hosted on [Heroku](https://ai-basketball-analysis.herokuapp.com/). However, the heavy computation of TensorFlow may cause Timeout error and crash the app (especially for video analysis). Therefore, hosting the project on your local machine is more preferable.

Please note that the shooting pose analysis won't be running on the Heroku hosted website, since a CUDA device is required to run OpenPose.

## Project Structure

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/structure.png"">
</p>

## Features

This project has three main features, [shot analysis](#shot-analysis), [shot detection](#shot-detection), [detection API](#detection-api).

### Shot and Pose analysis

#### Shot counting

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/analysis_result.PNG"">
</p>

Counting shooting attempts and missing, scoring shots from the input video.
Detection keypoints in different colors have different meanings listed below:
* **Blue:** Detected basketball in normal status
* **Purple**: Undetermined shot
* **Green:** Shot went in
* **Red:** Miss

#### Pose analysis

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/curry_pose.gif"" width=""800"" height=""450"">
</p>

Implementing [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) to calculate the angle of elbow and knee during shooting.

<p align=center>
    <img src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xaY-4TqFF6s/SgDgFQeGI6I/AAAAAAAAANk/I83JeZ89MOU/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Basketball+Free+Throw+Side+On1-031509.jpg"">
</p>

Release angle and release time are calculated by all the data collected from shot analysis and pose analysis. Please note that there will be a relatively big **error** for the release time since it was calculated as the total time when the ball is in hand.

### Shot detection

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/detection.PNG"">
</p>

Detection will be shown on the image. The confidence and the coordinate of the detection will be listed below.

### Detection API

<p align=center>
    <img src=""./static/img/API.PNG"" width=""861.6"" height=""649.6"">
</p>

Get the JSON response by submitting a **POST** request to (./detection_json) with ""image"" as KEY and input image as VALUE.

## Detection model

<p align=center>
    <img src=""https://jkjung-avt.github.io/assets/2018-03-30-making-frcn-faster/FRCN_architecture.png"" width=""558"" height=""560.5"">
</p>

The object detection model is trained with the [Faster R-CNN model architecture](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models), which includes pretrained weight on COCO dataset. Taking the configuration from the model architecture and train it on my own dataset.


## Future plans
- [ ] Change the model to a more efficient YOLOv4
- [ ] Implement SORT Tracking algorithm to filter out false detection
- [ ] Improve the visual effect
- [ ] Improve the efficiency, making it executable on web app services.

"
5,bttmly/nba,JavaScript,"# nba
*Node.js client for nba.com API endpoints*

`npm install nba`

## NOTES:

### BLACKLISTED IP ADDRESSES:
It appears as though the NBA has blacklisted certain blocks of IP addresses, specifically those of cloud hosting providers including AWS. As such, you may hit a situation where an application using this package works fine on your local machine, but doesn't work at all when deployed to a cloud server. Annoyingly, requests from these IPs seem to just hang. More information [here](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/issues/41) and [here](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py/issues/88) -- the second issue has a `curl` command somewhere which will quickly tell you if NBA is accepting requests from your IP. (Incidentally, this is also the same reason the TravisCI build is always ""broken"" but tests all pass locally). There is a simple pass-through server in `scripts/proxy` that can be used to get around this restriction; you can put the proxy server somewhere that can reach NBA.com (e.g. not on AWS or Heroku or similar) and host your actual application on a cloud provider.

### CORS restrictions on browser usage
This package can't be used directly from the browser because of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) restrictions imposed by nba.com. If you run some sort of intermediate server which relays requests to NBA.com, you can change the host the client points to by following the instructions in the *Transport Layer* section

## NBA API
The [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com) uses a large number of undocumented JSON endpoints to provide the statistics tables and charts displayed on that website. This library provides a JavaScript client for interacting with many of those API endpoints.

## Getting Started

`NBA.findPlayer(str)` will return an object with a player's name, their ID, and their team information. This method is built into the package.

All methods in the `NBA.stats` namespace require an object to be passed in as a parameter. The keys to the object are in the docs for the `stats` namespace [here](doc/stats.md)

```js
const NBA = require(""nba"");
const curry = NBA.findPlayer('Stephen Curry');
console.log(curry);
/* logs the following:
{
  firstName: 'Stephen',
  lastName: 'Curry',
  playerId: 201939,
  teamId: 1610612744,
  fullName: 'Stephen Curry',
  downcaseName: 'stephen curry'
}
*/
NBA.stats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: curry.playerId }).then(console.log);
```

For more example API calls, see `/test/integration/stats.js` and other test files.

## Stability Warning
This is a client for an unstable and undocumented API. While I try to follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for changes to the JavaScript API this library exposes, the underlying HTTP API can (and has) changed without warning. In particular, the NBA has repeatedly deprecated endpoints, or added certain required headers without which requests will fail. Further, this library comes bundled with a (relatively) up-to-date list of current NBA players which is subject to change at any time -- the specific contents of it should not be considered part of this library's API contract.

## Usability
To put it nicely, the NBA's API endpoints are a little clunky to work with. This library tries to strike a balance between being usable but not making assumptions about how the data will be used. Specifically, the NBA sends data in a concise ""table"" form where the column headers come first then each result is an array of values that need to be matched with the proper header. This library does a simple transformation to zip the header and values arrays into a header-keyed object. Beyond that, it tries to not do too much. This is important to note because sometimes the various ""result sets"" that come back on a single endpoint seem sort of arbitrary. The underlying HTTP API doesn't seem to follow standard REST practices; rather it seems the endpoints are tied directly to the data needed by specific tables and charts displayed on [stats.nba.com](). This is what I mean by ""clunky"" to work with -- it can be tricky to assemble the data you need for a specific analysis from the various endpoints available.

## Documentation
_still lots to do here..._

There are four primary parts of this library
- *Top-level methods*
- *`stats` namespace* &mdash; [docs](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/doc/stats.md)
- *`synergy` namespace* [see tests](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/test/integration/synergy.js)
– *`data` namespace* [see tests](https://github.com/bttmly/nba/blob/master/test/integration/data.js)
- *~`sportVu` namespace*~ NBA has removed sportVu endpoints. the methods exist here for backwards compatibility but they throw errors

## Transport Layer
In some cases you will want to use a different transport layer to handle HTTP requests. Perhaps you have an HTTP client library you like better than what I used here. Better yet, you want to get stats for the WNBA or the G League. The following code snippet shows how to use the `withTransport` method to create a new client with your own transport function.

```js
// here we are getting stats for the WNBA!

const nba = require(""nba"");
const getJSON = require(""nba/src/get-json"");

// for the G League, try ""stats.gleague.nba.com""
const newHost = ""stats.wnba.com"";

const transport = (url, params, options) => {
  // simply swap the host and then defer the rest to the built in getJSON function
  const fixedURL = url.replace(""stats.nba.com"", ""stats.wnba.com"");
  return getJSON(fixedURL, params, options);
};

// create a new stats client here with our WNBA transport
const wnbaStats = nba.stats.withTransport(transport);

(async () => {
  const result = await wnbaStats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: ""1628886"" });
  console.log(result);
})();
```

## ""I don't use Node.js""
Please take a look at [nba-client-template](http://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template). The relevant part of the repo is a single JSON document from which many programming languages can dynamically generate an API client. The repo contains (sloppy) examples in [Ruby](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.rb) and [Python](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.py). Compiled languages can use code generation techniques to the same effect -- there's a (again, sloppy) example in [Go](https://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/tree/master/example-clients/golang). If you'd like me to publish it to a specific registry so you can install it with your language's package manager, please [open an issue](http://github.com/bttmly/nba-client-template/issues). Please note, however, that package only includes  the endpoints exposed by this library under the `stats` namespace -- `sportvu` and `synergy` endpoints aren't yet included in it. I also plan to add a command-line interface to this library so that it can be easily driven as a child process by another program.

1. 由于腾讯视频对真实地址解析后播放进行了加密，故采用新方法进行真实地址解析，若遇到不可播放的视频，可点击右上角跳转到内嵌网页播放。
2. 增强UI体验。修复一些bug
3. 若初次体验V1.0 导致V1.1应用自动更新无法下载，则应到设置->应用->SprintNBA下，授予SD读写权限。

### V1.0
初次版本，含NBA新闻、视频花絮、赛程及文字直播、技术统计、球队及球员数据排行、详细资料，虎扑论坛专区。

7,linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements,Python,"# NBA Player Movements

This is a script for visualization of NBA games from raw SportVU logs.

If you admire both Spurs' and Warriors' ball movement, Brad Stevens' playbook, or just miss KD in OKC you'll find this entertaining.

## Examples

![Spurs](https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements/blob/master/examples/spurs.gif)
![Warriors](https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements/blob/master/examples/warriors.gif)
![Celtics](https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements/blob/master/examples/celtics.gif)
![Durant](https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements/blob/master/examples/durant.gif)

## Usage

1. Clone this repo:

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/linouk23/NBA-Player-Movements
  ```

2. Choose any NBA game from ```data/2016.NBA.Raw.SportVU.Game.Logs``` directory.

3. Generate an animation for the play by running the following script:

  ```bash
  $ python3 main.py --path=Celtics@Lakers.json --event=140
  ```

  ```
  required arguments:
    --path PATH    a path to json file to read the events from

  optional arguments:
    --event EVENT  an index of the event to create the animation to
                   (the indexing start with zero, if you index goes beyond out
                   the total number of events (plays), it will show you the last
                   one of the game)
    -h, --help     show the help message and exit
  ```

We also support older versions of Internet Explorer but the support is limited. For example, the Kickoff grid relies on flexbox so Modernizr is needed to detect for it and then we can provide a fallback.

[Basketball Reference](http://www.basketball-reference.com) is a great site (especially for a basketball stats nut like me), and hopefully they don't get too pissed off at me for creating this.

I initially wrote this library as an exercise for creating my first `PyPi` package - hope you find it valuable!

## ESPN API
This package uses ESPN's Fantasy API to extract data from any public or private league for **Fantasy Football and Basketball (NHL, MLB, and WNBA are in development)**.  
Please feel free to make suggestions, bug reports, and pull request for features or fixes!

This package was inspired and based off of [rbarton65/espnff](https://github.com/rbarton65/espnff).

## Installing
With Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api
cd espn-api
python3 setup.py install
```
With pip:
```
pip install espn_api
```

## Usage
### [For Getting Started and API details head over to the Wiki!](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/wiki)
```python
# Football API
from espn_api.football import League
# Basketball API
from espn_api.basketball import League
# Hockey API
from espn_api.hockey import League
# Baseball API
from espn_api.baseball import League
# Init
league = League(league_id=222, year=2019)
```

### Run Tests
```
python3 setup.py nosetests
```
## [Discussions](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions) (new)
If you have any questions about the package, ESPN API data, or want to talk about a feature please start a [discussion](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/discussions)! 


## Issue Reporting
If you find a bug follow the steps below for reporting.

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/issues) with a brief description of the bug for the title. In the title also add which sport (Football or Basketball)

2. Run the application in debug mode to view ESPN API request's and response's
    ```python
    # ... import statement above
    league = League(league_id=1245, year=2019, debug=True)
    ```
    The application will print all requests and the response from ESPN's API in the console. I would suggest piping the console output to a text file as it will be a lot of data.

3. Find the last log before the crash and copy it in the issue descrption with the line number of the crash or possible bug.

4. Submit the new issue!

I will try to comment on the issue as soon as possible with my thoughts and possible fix!

clone慢的可以用 gitee链接 https://gitee.com/hegaojian/MvvmHelper

## 1.如何集成

- **1.1 在root's build.gradle中加入 Jitpack 仓库 **

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

- **1.2 在app's build.gradle中添加依赖**

```gradle
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'

...

dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.hegaojian:MvvmHelper:1.1.7'
  kapt 'com.github.liujingxing.rxhttp:rxhttp-compiler:2.9.3'
}
```

- **1.3 在app's build.gradle中，android 模块下开启DataBinding或者ViewBinding 可以自行选择**

``` gradle
AndroidStudio 4.0 以下版本------>
android {
    ...
    dataBinding {
        enabled = true //可选 不用可以不写
    }
    viewBinding {
        enabled = true //可选 不用可以不写
    }
}

AndroidStudio 4.0及以上版本 ------>
android {
    ...
   buildFeatures {
        dataBinding = true //可选 不用可以不写
        viewBinding = true //可选 不用可以不写
    }
}
 
```

- **1.4 在Application中初始化**

```kotlin
 MvvmHelper.init(this,BuildConfig.DEBUG)
```


## 混淆

``` kotlin 
-keepclassmembers class * implements androidx.viewbinding.ViewBinding {
  public static * inflate(android.view.LayoutInflater);
  public static * inflate(android.view.LayoutInflater, android.view.ViewGroup, boolean);
  public static * bind(android.view.View);
}
```

**This project is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please
see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.**

## Development Info

If you just want to play the game, go to <https://zengm.com/>. Instructions
below are for developers who want to run a copy locally so they can make changes
to the code.

If you want to contribute but get stuck somewhere, please contact me! I'm happy
to help.

### License and Contributor License Agreement

**This project is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please
see LICENSE.md for details.**

If you want to contribute code to this project, you must sign a contributor
license agreement. There are separate forms for individuals and entities (such
as corporations):

* [Individual CLA](CLA-individual.md) (this is probably what you want)
* [Entity CLA](CLA-entity.md)

Make a copy of the form, fill in your information at the bottom, and send an
email to jeremy@zengm.com with the subject line, ""Contributor License Agreement
from YOUR_NAME_HERE (GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE)"".

### Step 1 - Installing

Make sure you're using a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), older
versions probably won't work. Then, all of the tooling used in development can
be set up by simply installing [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) and
running:

    yarn install

from within this folder.

### Step 2 - Building

To build the app along with all its assets, run

    yarn run build

However during development, you probably would rather do

    yarn run start-watch

which will start the server and watch JS and CSS files for changes and
recompile. This simply runs both `yarn run start` and `yarn run watch` together,
which alternatively can be run separately if you wish.

By default this will build the basketball version of the game. For other sports,
set the SPORT environment variable to ""football"", ""baseball"", or ""hockey"", like:

    SPORT=football yarn run start-watch

Open `package.json` to see all available development scripts.

### Step 3 - Running

To run the game locally, you need some way of running a web server to display
the content. There are currently two ways to do it. It doesn't matter which you
use as long as you can get it to run on your computer.

#### 1. Node.js (easiest)

Run

    yarn run start

and point your browser to <http://localhost:3000/>. If you use the command `yarn
run start-watch` from above, then running the command `yarn run start` is not
necessary.

#### 2. Apache

The mod_rewrite rules in `.htaccess` let the game run in Apache. Everything
should work if you point it at the `build` folder with mod_rewrite enabled.

### Step 4 - Testing

TypeScript and ESLint are used to enforce some coding standards. To run them on
the entire codebase, run

    yarn run lint

Integration and unit tests spread out through the codebase in *.test.ts files.
Coverage is not great. They can be run from the command line with

    yarn test

There is also a single end-to-end test which creates a league and simulates a
season. To execute the end-to-end test, run

    yarn run test-e2e

For the end-to-end test, by default it is basketball. If you want it to do
football, stick `SPORT=football ` in front.

### Code Overview

This is a single-page app that runs almost entirely client-side by storing data
in IndexedDB. The core of the game runs inside a Shared Worker (or a Web Worker
in crappy browsers that don't support Shared Workers), and then each open tab
runs only UI code that talks to the worker. The UI code is in the `src/ui`
folder and the core game code is in the `src/worker` folder. They communicate
through the `toUI` and `toWorker` functions.

The UI is built with React and Bootstrap.

In the worker, data is ultimately stored in IndexedDB, but for performance and
cross-browser compatibility reasons, a cache (implemented in
`src/worker/db/Cache.ts`) sits on top of the database containing all commonly
accessed data. The idea is that IndexedDB should only be accessed for uncommon
situations, like viewing stats from past seasons. For simulating games and
viewing current data, only the cache should be necessary.

The cache is overly complicated because (1) the values it returns are mutable,
so you better not mess with them accidentally, and (2) when you do purposely
mutate a value (like updating a player's stats), you need to remember to always
write it back to the cache manually by calling `idb.cache.*.put`.

In both the worker and UI processes, there is a global variable `self.bbgm`
which gives you access to many of the internal functions of the game from
within your browser.

### Shared Worker Debugging

As mentioned above, the core of a game runs in a Shared Worker. This makes
debugging a little tricky. For instance, in Chrome, if you `console.log`
something inside the Shared Worker, you won't see it in the normal JS console.
Instead, you need to go to chrome://inspect/#workers and click ""Inspect"" under
<http://localhost/gen/worker.js>.

In any browser, if you have two tabs open and you reload one of them, the worker
process will not reload. So make sure you close all tabs except one before
reloading if you want to see changes in the worker.

### Service Worker

This only applies if you use Apache, not if you use `yarn run start`!

A service worker is used for offline caching. This can make development tricky,
because if you load the game in your browser, make a change, wait for
build/watch to finish, and then reload... you will not see your change because
it will cache the original version and then not update it on a reload. This is
the normal behavior for service workers (they only switch to a new version when
you actually close the website and reopen it, not on a reload), but it makes
development annoying.

To work around that, in Chrome you can [use the ""Update on reload"" option][1]
and keep your devtools open. Then reloading will always get you the latest
version.

Even with that, ctrl+shift+r may be a good idea to make sure you're seeing your
latest changes.

### Git Workflow

If you want to contribute changes back to the project, first create a fork on
GitHub. Then make your changes in a new branch. Confirm that the tests
(hopefully including new ones you wrote!) and ESLint all pass. Finally, send me
a pull request.

It's also probably a good idea to create an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm/issues) before you start working
on something to keep me in the loop.

## Less Important Development Info

### Sport-specific stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com and
football-reference.com stat pages. For instance, ""defensive rebounds"" is ""drb"".

Sport Game Outcome Prediction Project - Bet on Sibyl 
======================
### Bet on Sibyl in a nutshell

BetonSibyl is a platform controlled by a set of algorithmic models (a model defined for each sport)
that projects accurately estimated results (predictions of upcoming games) from a multitude of statistical variables.
At launch, the platform will cover the four major US sports (Football, Basketball, Baseball, Hockey), Soccer and Tennis.
Moreover, the models provide stats to measure the
performance of the algorithm for the current season (for each sport) along with bankroll comparaison stats with bookmaker 
(scraping from the [oddsportal's website](http://www.oddsportal.com/) to do so). Here's below an image from the mobile app 
propotype based on the platform.

## Data collection

### Data Design Decisions

1. It is decided that the two participating teams/players in each matchup are respectively represented by visitor team and home team (player A/player B in case of Tennis).
 This is contrary to another popular method of representing the teams as the favorite and underdog.

2. The point differential is chosen to be positive when the home team scores more points than the away team.

3. To represent the difference between the two teams that are playing in the matchup, the ratio or the difference between
 the same attributes are taken between the two teams. That is, the home team’s statistic is divided by the visitor team’s
  statistic. Therefore, when attributes are a positive indicator of performance, a value greater than 1 indicates that
   the home team performs better for that particular attribute. When the attributes are integers (not statistics), then 
   the difference between the home team’s attribute and the away team’s attribute is taken. Examples of this are win 
   streak, compared to statistics such as points per game that would be compared by taking the ratio.


### Web Scraping

The data is scraped from several websites according to each sport using Python and the Selenium and BeautifulSoup (only for MLB data)
 packages for Python. Data sources for each sports are described in the ""Link"" section. 
 According to each sport/league, the script goes through each summary season page and writes season team stats and season game stats 
 (e.g. date, the home team, away team, home team points, away team points etc.) to a csv file.
Game stat data, team stat data, and datetime data are merge later into a feature file (.npz) for the ML algorithm (Lasso Logistic Regression)
Here's below an example team stats data and game stats data for the NFL league.
In the same scripts, After having obtained the raw data set, data is cleaned throughout the script. The script
checked the completeness and validity of all the data files, and eliminated any CSV parsing errors
or erroneous data values.

## Predictions

### Data preprocessing

Data preprocessing is made in the Prepare_for_ML.py file. Here is the main idea:
Having validated all our available data, the script then proceeded to load the data from the csv files
into an SQL database using the SQLite single-file database engine and a few Python scripts. The
flexibility of SQL queries allowed one to easily perform complex joins and merges between multiple
tables via the the script.
Instead of using each team’s attribute independently in the analysis, attributes are formed to represent the difference
 between the attribute for the two participating teams in the matchup. For example, in the NBA league the attributes 
 ‘average_blocks_per_game_home’ and ‘average_blocks_per_game_away’ are not used in the analysis, rather, 
 the ratio between the two values is used. 
 
 Thus, the script converts the clean scraped data to data structures that the libraries in scikit-learn can easily use. 
 The ultimate result of the routines included in this file is a numpy array containing all the features and game results
  for the historical game data. The structure 'features.npz' contains this output and is eventually loaded by scikit-learn.
   The features have not been normalized but the next script provide one the ability to easily normalize or standardize the data. 

### Algorithm Tuning and Running

This step is located in the ""RunModelLeague.py""
According to each sport, it uses scikit-learn and historical game results (in the .npz file) to make predictions on the current season games
 that have not been played.
 A logistic regression predictive model with the L1 penalty is created. Analysis of results are output to csv files.

 Here is below an example of the output for the 2017 nba season
 
 ![Sibyl Logo](Images/nba_tableau_output_2017_img.png)
 
 Then, webscraping (through the ScrapeMatchupDatetimeOddsTwoChoicesLeague.py file) is performed  through the betbrain's website so as one can have more information on each league upcoming match.
Thus, the final output give additionnal detail such as odds for both home and away teams, the choice of the bookmaker 
(e.g. the team with the lowest odd if designed to be the bookmaker choice), the choice of the algorithm (Sibyl), if 
there is a divergence or no between Sibyl and the bookmaker ('Y' = yea, 'N' = no).
Here's below an example of the final output for the Ligue 1 soccer league.


 ![Sibyl Logo](Images/final_output_football_ligue1.png)


## Results Presentation
 

### Model Performance Metrics

First of all, webscraping (through the SibylVsBookiesNFL.py file) is performed in order to have sufficient data to make comparison with
bookmakers over the year ([oddsportal's website](http://www.oddsportal.com/)). 
Below you can see an example of output that help one make a clear performance comparison between Sibyl and the bookies 
for the 2016 MLB season.

 ![Sibyl Logo](Images/Sibyl_vs_Bookies_MLB.png)
 
Then, algorithm performance measure is performed through the ModelMetricsLeague.py file
The script provides one for a given league data such as algorithm accuracy (e.g. % of correct predictions) up-to-date, the team of the month to
bet on (team which has performed well when chosen by the algorithm), the worst team of the month, The top teams to bet on 
based on the divergence stategy etc...

### ML one-sport process in a nutshell

For a given league, the entire process described above can be run via the ModelLeague.py file.
Here is an example of the process code for the

## NBA Player Performance Prediction and Lineup Optimization

Prediction of NBA player performance defined as Fantasy Points by Draft Kings. This capstone project was conducted and approved by a reviewer as part of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. See the final report [here](https://github.com/KengoA/fantasy-basketball/blob/master/report.pdf) for details.

Note that the code was updated since the writing of the report and the content does not necessarily match up. This project is under minor refactoring and documentation as of Jun 2019, feel free to reach out to me via email at kengo@hey.com.

### What We'll Do

The end goal of this project is to generate a series of lineups for a fantasy basketball website [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/). To achieve that, we'll scrape player statististics from each regular season game starting in the 2014-15 season as well as past fantasy salary information. First, we'll build a predictive model for player performance, and then we will use genetic algorithm to construct fantasy lineups to maximize the total fantasy points while satisfying the salary constraint.

### What We Won't Do

Given the complexity of the series structure and difference in nature, we won't be considering playoff games. In addition, a major factor omitted from our analysis is the opponent's defensive ability as a team or at a given position (for instance, Paul George is excellent at stealing the ball), which arguably is one of the most important factors of the game. Tackling this aspect will be an easy improvement to this project.

### Requirements

Along with libraries specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), you need to sign up with Plotly for free to create interactive visualizations.

### Understanding Fantasy Sports

The key to select a good fantasy lineup is to identify players that are consistent performers. This basic intuition comes from Harry Morkowitz's [Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp), and the following scatter plot looks at the relationship between risk and return, where return is the average fantasy points over a given range of games (in this case, past 10 games) and risk is its standard deviation. For a given level of risk (x-axis), a player with a better return is considered to be superior. The plot is based on the late 2018-19 season statistics, where, for instance, Lebron James is shown in the top-left with a 10-game average of a whopping 58.1 fantasy points and a 7.4 standard deviation. The top curve starting from Harden (top right), Lebron, Paul George, Gorbert, Sexton, and Zubac can be considered as [Efficient Frontier](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp) in the framework of the MPT. In general, players on the outer left of the cluster are considered as good assets with low risk and high return. Players are color-coded based on rough positions of PG, SG, F (SF, PF, SF/PF), and C (PF/C, C). A fully interactive version can be accessed [here](https://plot.ly/~KengoA/12/_10-game-risk-return-relationship/#/).

![10-game risk-return](assets/risk_return.gif)

Another important dimension of the game of fantasy basketball is player salary. Fantasy sports websites like DraftKings determine player salary values given their previous performance and roster information in a semi-automatic fashion, such that it is more costly to include ""stud"" players with high expected return (LeBron, Westbrook, Harden) into your lineup. DraftKings has a salary cap of $50,000 for a selection of 8 players, giving each player an average salary of $6250. The graph below shows a scatterplot of a player's salary and his actual performance of the day in the latest games of the 2018-19 season. One striking insight is that while it is easy to identify studs like Westbrook who had a total fantasy poitns of 61.5 for his 11.8k salary April 10, ""value"" players who exceed expectations are much more difficult to find, with a large variance given a salary level. For instance, Jamal Crawford on the top left had monstrous performance for a combined fantasy points of 70.25, despite the low expectation of his \$4300 salary. These ""value"" players are what differentiates winning lineups from those of a typical beginner with a collection of star players and underachieving benchwarmers. This requires deeper insight into who will outperform their expectations. For instance, an injury of a starting player most likely increases minutes for other starting members and the second option player on the bench. A fully interactive version can be accessed [here](https://plot.ly/~KengoA/14/salary-return-relationship/#/).

### Project Structure

This project consists of 9 Jupyter notebooks and functionalities are described below, where the second half consists of construcing machine leanring models and making inference, and optimising lineups for DraftKings.

- [01.data_scraping.ipynb](src/01.data_scraping.ipynb) scrapes games data from Basketball-Reference.com and salary and position information from RotoGuru.

- [02.merging_data.ipynb](src/02.preprocessing.ipynb) merges the two datasets with name standardisation and preliminary preprocessing of data such as calculation of FPTS based on the key statistics.

- [03.exploratory_analysis.ipynb](src/03.exploratory_analysis.ipynb) visually explores relationships between; salary and actual FPTS and; expected FPTS and standard deviation of the past 10 games.

- [04.feature_engineering.ipynb](src/04.feature_engineering.ipynb) constructs the baseline model with simple average along with additional three datasets with weighted average, where several features are engineered and incorporated.

- [05.baseline_models.ipynb](src/05.baseline_models.ipynb) sets up the baseline model with simple season average adopted by DraftKings and linear regression with feature selection models. For notebooks 06-08, we use 5-fold cross validation to approximate model errors.

- [06.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb](src/06.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb) uses bayesian optimisation method to find the best parameters for a boosting model using lightGBM. Parameters and their results are saved in a text file.

- [07.neural_networks.ipynb](src/07.neural_networks.ipynb) constructs three neural network models using keras, and saves model weights only when there was an improvement. While deep learning models might not suit this dataset of limited size, it shows improvement compared to boosting models.

  ![learning](assets/learning.png)

- [08.predictions.ipynb](src/08.predictions.ipynb) trains on the whole dataset except for the month of March 2019, where each contest's cashline for double up was manually obtained from RotoGrinders. Inference is made on this test data from March 2019.

- [09.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb](src/06.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb) uses Genetic Algorithms to select best combinations of players on a given set of games ans predictions. Performance of the lineups chosen by the algorithm against other DraftKings users is examined for contests held in March, 2019. Note that the contest data is manually obtained from Rotogrindrs' ResultsDB page without scraping. Predictions from the baseline model and final model are compared to the actual performance. The following figure shows the optimal lineup this model returns, with differences between the actual FPTS and predicted FPTS with neural network and baseline models.

Main procedures are coded and explained in markdown using Jupyter Notebook. Although not requred, jupyter nbextentions are highly recommended for convenience and visibility (see link). Useful extensions are Codefolding, ExecuteTime, Collapsible Headings, and Variable Inspector. http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

[Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) is a great resource to aggregate statistics on NBA teams, seasons, players, and games. This package provides methods to acquire data for all these categories in pre-parsed and simplified formats.

## Installing
### Via `pip`
I wrote this library as an exercise for creating my first PyPi package. Hopefully, you find it easy to use.
Install using the following command:

```
pip install basketball-reference-scraper
```

### Via GitHub
Alternatively, you can just clone this repo and import the libraries at your own discretion.

## Wait, don't scrapers like this already exist?

Yes, scrapers and APIs do exist. The primary API used currently is for [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com/), but the website blocks too many requests, hindering those who want to acquire a lot of data. Additionally, scrapers for [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) do exist, but none of them load dynamically rendered content. These scrapers can only acquire statically loaded content, preventing those who want statistics in certain formats (for example, Player Advanced Stats Per Game).

### API
Currently, the package contains 5 modules: `teams`, `players`, `seasons`, `box_scores`, `pbp`, `shot_charts`, and `injury_report`. 
The package will be expanding to include other content as well, but this is a start.

For full details on the API please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper/blob/master/API.md).

21,neeilan/DeepPlayByPlay,Python,"# Deep Play-by-Play

This repo contains model and data collection / preprocessing code to label NBA broadcast footage with play-by-play descriptions, using 3D ConvNet-based video classification.

To learn how to scrape labelled videos off NBA.com for similar projects, see [data_utils/README](data_utils/README.md).


### Classification performance
After training on about 3000 training examples (~6000 with augmentation), on a test set with 253 test examples (both sets somewhat evenly divided among 6 classes), the following accuracies were achieved:

| # classes        | Classes           | Accuracy  |
| ------------- |:-------------| :-----|
| 6      | (Inside/Midrange/Three) (Make/Miss) | 66% |
| 4      | (Two/Three) (Make/Miss)      | 74% |
| 2 | (Make/Miss)      | 91% |


### Running the code

You should be able to clone this repo, set up paths appropriately in `config.py`, and run training or inference. All dependencies for this project ship with either the Python 3 standard library or the everyday machine/deep learning toolkit (TensorFlow, keras, scikit-learn). To read videos from disk, I use [scikit-video](http://www.scikit-video.org/stable/io.html) io module, which you may need to install. Training data isn't hosted in this repo because it is quite large even after downsampling, and I don't have the [express written consent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyj-7bDr7fs) of the NBA.
However, the pre-trained weights file is available in the `weights` directory.


### Examples:

The ultimate goal is continuous video classification, on running broadcast footage. However, I didn't have access to labelled data for non-field goal events (like rebounds, free throws, players running down the court, Javale doing dumb shit, etc). As a result, these examples use 90-frame (at 8 fps, so about 11 seconds long) videos of field-goal make/miss events - the only kind the model can currently identify.

Since all data used for training and testing was from the 2017-18 season, I picked out several plays from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjX71R69jlA) of the last 5 minutes of Spurs/Rockets Game 5 in the 2017 playoffs to see how accurately plays from a completely different season are classified:

<img src=""assets/PLAY_1.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_1.png"" width=""50%"">
<img src=""assets/PLAY_2.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_2.png"" width=""50%"">
<img src=""assets/PLAY_4.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_4.png"" width=""50%"">
<img src=""assets/PLAY_5.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_5.png"" width=""50%"">

### Incorrect classification examples:
...because, like most things in life, this isn't perfect:

This Danny Green and-one is best classified as an `INSIDE_MAKE`, but `MIDRANGE_MAKE` is not a terribly bad guess:

<img src=""assets/PLAY_7.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_7.png"" width=""50%"">


The following play is an offensive foul followed by a `MIDRANGE_MISS`, but is classified as more likely to be an `INSIDE_MAKE` (51%) than a `MIDRANGE_MISS` (27%):

<img src=""assets/PLAY_6.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_6.png"" width=""50%"">


Sometimes, the classifier flat-out fails confidently :disappointed: :

<img src=""assets/PLAY_3.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_3.png"" width=""50%"">
<img src=""assets/PLAY_FAIL.gif"" width=""45%""> <img src=""assets/PROBS_FAIL.png"" width=""50%"">

Note that some of these plays are quite difficult to judge properly at this resolution and frame rate, without sound. Now imagine that these videos are also black and white, and that is the kind of data that this model has been trained on. Therefore, it's unsurprising that it isn't very good, but working with higher quality videos requires significantly more computational resources :moneybag:.


### FAQ
I'll fill this out if and when people ask questions.

[Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9oyzhr/oc_a_side_project_ive_been_working_on_using_deep/)
"
22,lbenz730/ncaahoopR,R,"# ncaahoopR <img src=""figures/logo.png"" align=""right"" />

`ncaahoopR` is an R package for working with NCAA Basketball Play-by-Play Data. It scrapes play-by-play data and returns it to the user in a tidy format, allowing the user to explore the data with assist networks, shot charts, and in-game win-probability charts.

For pre-scraped schedules, rosters, box scores, and play-by-play data, check out the [ncaahoopR_data repository](https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR_data).

To see the lastest changes in version 1.5, view the change log [here](https://lukebenz.com/post/ncaahoopr_v1.5/).

## Installation
You can install `ncaahoopR` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages(""devtools"")
devtools::install_github(""lbenz730/ncaahoopR"")
```

If you encounter installation issues, the following tips have helped a few users successfully install the package:

* If given the option to compile any packages from source rather than installing existing binaries, choose `'No'`.
* Windows users with trouble installing the package should try running the following command before reinstalling the package: `Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = ""true"")`
* Windows users with trouble installing `devtools` should try first installing the `backports` package via `install.packages(""backports"")`.


## Functions
Several functions use ESPN game_ids. You can find the game_id in the URL for the game summary, 
as shown in the URL for the summary of the UMBC-Virginia game below.
![game_id](figures/espn.png)

### Scraping Data
* ```get_pbp(team, season)```: Get entire current season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team and season. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 
* ```get_pbp_game(game_ids, extra_parse)```:  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of ESPN game_ids. `extra_parse` is a logical whether to link shot variables and attempt possesion parsing. Default =   `TRUE`.
* ```get_roster(team, season)```: Get a particular team's roster. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 
* ```get_schedule(team, season)```: Get a team's schedule. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 
* ```get_game_ids(team, season)```: Get a vector of ESPN game_ids for all games involving ```team``` specified. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form.
* ```get_master_schedule(date)```: Get schedule of all games for given date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD` date formatting.
* `get_boxscore(game_id)`: Returns list of 2 data frames, one with each teams' box score for the game in question. Written by [Jared Andrews](https://github.com/j-andrews7).

* `season_boxscore(team, season = current_season, aggregate = 'average')`: Returns (aggregated) player stats over the course of a season for a given team.
        * `team`: team to return player stats for.
        * `season`: of form YYYY-YY. Defaults to current season.
        * `aggregate`: one of 'average' (per-game average statistics), 'total' (sums of season stats) or 'raw' (just return all box scores binded together). 'average' is the default. Contributed in collaboration with [Kurt Wirth](https://github.com/kurtawirth)

The `team` parameter in the above functions must be a valid team name from the `ids` dataset built into the package. See the __Datasets__ section below for more details.

### Win-Probability and Game-Flow Charts

__Win Probability Charts__

The latest function for plotting win probability charts is `wp_chart_new`. Following the 2021-22 season other win probability chart functions will be deprecated and replaced by this function (it will be renamed to `wp_chart` but I don't want to break any existing pipelines during the season). It no longer requires users to input colors. For best results consider saving via ggsave(filename, height = 9/1.2, width = 16/1.2) (or some other 16/9 aspect ratio.) 

```wp_chart_new(game_id, home_col = NULL, away_col = NULL, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)```

* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team (if NULL will default to `ncaa_colors` primary_color field).
* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team (if NULL will default to `ncaa_colors` primary_color field).
* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.
* ```show_legend```: Logical, whether or not to show legend/text on chart. Default = `TRUE`.


A prior version of `wp_chart` used base R while `gg_wp_chart` used the `ggplot2` plotting library. As of the 2020-21 season, both functions call the same `ggplot2` library, and `gg_wp_chart` now simply aliases `wp_chart`

```wp_chart(game_id, home_col, away_col, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)```

* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.
* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team.
* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.
* ```show_legend```: Logical, whether or not to show legend/text on chart. Default = `TRUE`.


```gg_wp_chart(game_id, home_col, away_col, show_labels = T)```

* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.
* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team.
* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.
* `show_labels`: Logical whether Game Excitement Index and Minimum Win Probability metrics should be displayed on the plot. Default = `TRUE`.

__Game Flow Charts__

```game_flow(game_id, home_col, away_col)```

* ```game_id``` ESPN game_id for the desired contest.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team.
* ```away_col``` Chart color for away team.

__Game Excitement Index__

```game_exciment_index(game_id, include_spread = T)```

* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.

Returns ```GEI``` (Game Excitement Index) for given ESPN game_id. For more information about how these win-probability charts are fit and how Game Excitement Index is calculated, check out the below links



* [Model Methodology](https://lukebenz.com/post/ncaahoopr_win_prob/)
* [Game Excitement Index](https://lukebenz.com/post/gei/)

__Game Control Measures__

```average_win_prob(game_id, include_spread = T)```

* ESPN game_id for which to compute time-based average win probability (from perspective of home team).
* `include_spread`: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = `TRUE`.

```average_score_diff(game_id)```

* ESPN game_id for which to compute time-based average score differential (from perspective of home team).



### Assist Networks

__Traditional Assist Networks__

```assist_net(team, season, node_col, three_weights = T, threshold = T, message = NA, return_stats = T)```

* ```team``` is the ESPN team name, as listed in the `ids` data frame.
* ```season``` Options include ""2018-19"" (for entire season), or a vector of ESPN game IDs. 
* ```node_col``` is the node color for the graph.
* ```three_weights``` (default = ```TRUE```): Logical. If TRUE, assisted three-point shots are given a weight of 1.5. If FALSE, assisted three-point shots are given a weight of 1. In both cases, assisted two-point shots are given a weight of 1. 
* `threshold` (default = 0) Number between 0-1 indicating minimum percentage of team's assisted baskets a player needs to be involved in to be included in network graph.
* ```message``` (default = ```NA```) Option for custom message to replace graph title when using a subset of the season (e.g. conference play).
* `return_stats` (default = `TRUE`) Return Assist Network-related statistics

__Circle Assist Networks and Player Highlighting__

```circle_assist_net(team, season, highlight_player = NA, highlight_color = NA, three_weights = T, threshold = 0, message = NA, return_stats = T)```

* ```team``` is the ESPN team name, as listed in the `ids` data frame.
* ```season```: Options include ""YYYY-YY"" (for entire season), or a vector of ESPN game IDs. 
* ```highlight_player``` (default = `NA`) Name of player to highlight in assist network. `NA` yields full-team assist network with no player highlighting.
* ```highlight_color``` (default = `NA`) Color of player links to be highlighted. `NA` if ```highlight_player``` is `NA`.
* ```three_weights``` (default = ```TRUE```): Logical. If TRUE, assisted three-point shots are given a weight of 1.5. If FALSE, assisted three-point shots are given a weight of 1. In both cases, assisted two-point shots are given a weight of 1.  
* `threshold` (default = 0) Number between 0-1 indicating minimum percentage of team's assisted baskets a player needs to be involved in to be included in network graph.
* `message` (default = `NA`) User-supplied plot title to overwrite default plot title, if desired.
* `return_stats` (default = `TRUE`) Return Assist Network-related statistics

### Shot Charts
There are currently three functions for scraping and plotting shot location data. These functions are written by [Meyappan Subbaiah](https://github.com/meysubb).

`get_shot_locs(game_id)`: Returns data frame with shot location data when available. Note that if the `extra_parse` flag in `get_pbp_game` is set to `TRUE`, shot location data will already be included in the play-by-play data (if available).

* `game_id`: ESPN game_id from which shot locations should be scraped.

`game_shot_chart(game_id, heatmap = F)`: Plots shots for a given game.

* `game_id`: ESPN game_id from which shot locations should be scraped.
* `heatmap` (default = `FALSE`): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.
* shot-plotting colors derived from team's primary color listed in `ncaa_colors` data frame.

`team_shot_chart(game_ids, team, heatmap = F)`: Plots shots taken by team during a given set of game(s).

* `game_ids`: Vector of ESPN game_ids from which shot locations should be scraped.
* `team`: Which team to chart shots for.
* `heatmap` (default = `FALSE`): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.
* shot-plotting colors derived from team's primary color listed in `ncaa_colors` data frame.

`opp_shot_chart(game_ids, team, heatmap = F)`: Plots shots against a team during a given set of game(s).

* `game_ids`: Vector of ESPN game_ids from which shot locations should be scraped.
* `team`: Which team to chart opponents' shots for.
* `heatmap` (default = `FALSE`): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.

## Glossary
Play-by-Play files contain the following variables:

* ```game_id```: ESPN game_id for the game in question.
* ```date```: Date of game.
* ```home```: Name of the home team.
* ```away```: Name of the away team.
* ```play_id```: Unique identifier of play/event in sequence of game events.
* ```half```: Period of action in the game. 1 and 2 denote the first and second halves of play, while 3 denotes OT1, 4 denotes OT2 etc.
* ```time_remaining_half```: Time remaining in the period as it would appear on a scoreboard.
* ```secs_remaining```: Time remaining in regulation, in seconds.
* ```secs_remaining_absolute```: The time remaining until the game is over, in seconds. For example a game that goes to overtime would begin with 2700 seconds remaining (2400 for regulation and 300 for overtime), and regulation would end with 300 seconds remaining.
* ```description```: A description of the play/game event.
* ```home_score```: Home team's score.
* ```away_score```: Away team's score.
* ```score_diff```: Score differential from the home team's perspective (```home_score``` - ```away_score```)
* ```play_length```: Duration of the the given play, in seconds.
* ```win_prob```: Win probability for the home team.
* ```naive_win_prob```: Win probability for the home team not factoring in pre-game point spread. Useful for computation of win probability added (WPA).
* ```home_timeout_remaining```: Number of timeouts remaining for the home team.
* ```away_timeout_remaining```: Number of timeouts remaining for the away team.
* ```home_favored_by```: Number of points by which the home team is favored, prior to tip-off. If Vegas point spread is available on ESPN, that is used as the default. When not available, an attempt is made to impute the pre-game point spread from derived team strengths. Imputed point spreads are not available for games prior to the 2016-17 season or when one of the teams is not in Division 1.
* ```total_line```: Total Vegas over/under for the game, where available.
* ```referees``` Referees for the game.
* `arena_location`: City in which the game was played.
* `arena`: Name of arena where game was played.
* `capacity`: Capacity of arena where game was played.
* `attendance`: Attendance of game, where available.
* `wrong_time`: An attempt to label play-by-play events tagged at the wrong time. These are filtered out of all graphical and statistical helper functions, but may still be useful for certain analyses where time of event is of less importance.

If `extra_parse = TRUE` in `get_pbp_game`, the following variables are also included.

* `shot_x`: The half-court x coordinate of shot. 
* `shot_y`: The half-court y coordinate of shot. (0,0) represents the bottom left corner and (50, 47) represents the top right corner (from persepective of standing under hoop).
* `shot_team`: Name of team taking shot.
* `shot_outcome`: Whether the shot was `made` or `missed`.
* `shooter`: Name of player taking shot.
* `assist`: Name of player asssisting shot (assisted shots only)
* `three_pt`: Logical, if shot is 3-point field goal attempt.
* `free_throw`: Logical, if shot is free throw attempt.

---
Stand-alone shot location data frames contain the following variables.

* `team_name`: Name of shooting team.
* `shot_text`: Description of shot.
* `color`: Color hexcode used to render shot chart graphic on ESPN.
* `date`: Date of game
* `outcome`: Whether the shot was made or missed
* `shooter`: Player attempting the shot
* `assister`: Playing assisting the shot
* `three_pt`: Logical, whether the shot is a 3-point attempt
* `x`: x-coordinate of shot location
* `y`: y-coordinate of shot location

The court is 50 feet by 94 feet, with (0,0) always being placed in the bottom left corner of the shot chart. Any full-court shot chart rendered using `game_shot_chart()` preserves ESPN shot locations as they are found online, while halfcourt charts using `team_shot_chart()` convert all shot locations to to a 50 feet by 47 feet halfcourt. The perspective on the halfcourt shot charts is as if one is standing under the hoop, looking toward the opposition hoop. (0,0) again represents the bottom left corner and (50, 47) represents the top right corner.

23,RobRomijnders/RNN_basketball,Python,"# LSTM with MDN for basketball trajectories

This is the code repository for our paper, [Applying Deep Learning to Basketball Trajectories](http://www.large-scale-sports-analytics.org/Large-Scale-Sports-Analytics/Submissions_files/paperID07.pdf). We also have written a short interactive [summary of the paper](http://tinyurl.com/traj-rnn) or find the full paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03793).  

This repo contains the data and tensorflow models we used in the paper. To run this code, it is necessary to have installed:  
- Tensorflow > 0.8
- Numpy
- Sklearn

## To create a model
* Unpack the seq_all.csv.tar.gz
* Run __main.py__ (This python script was designed to be run within an IDE, but will function as a standalone script.)
    * Within main.py there are a number of configuration settings that can be modified. These include settings for the model architecture, sequence length, distance to the basket, and performance measures. There is also an option to turn plotting on and see output at different model stages.

## The files
* main.py is the main file
* dataloader.py contains a class to load the data
    * util_*.py are two files with utility functions

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/andrewgiessel/basketballcrawler](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/andrewgiessel/basketballcrawler?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a python module to scrape [basketball-reference.com](http://www.basketball-reference.com/) and convert various
stats into usable data structures for analysis.

[Here](example_notebook.ipynb) is a link to a
sample IPython Notebook file demonstrating the library.


Requirements
------------

- [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#) >= 4.0
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) >= 0.11
- [request](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) >= 2.0


Usage
-----

Still developing the API.  Right now you can get a list of all player overview urls, generate a list of game log urls for
a given player, and convert that list into pandas dataframe.


Notes
-----

`players.json` was generated on 02/11/2016 by `buildPlayerDictionary()` and `savePlayerDictionary()`.
I'd recommend building your own, fresh copy. It takes about 10 minutes to scrape from the site.
To create the most recent `players.json`, you can use as follows.

```python
import basketballCrawler as bc
players = bc.buildPlayerDictionary()
bc.savePlayerDictionary(players, '/path/to/file')
```

You can also download generated `players.json`. However, note that it's a pretty large (13M) file.

```python
players = bc.loadPlayerDictionary('/path/to/players.json')
```

In order to search player name, use `searchForName` function, for example,

```python
searched_player = bc.searchForName(players, 'Murphey') # players is player dictionary
```


TODO
----
- Local Database construction.
- League-wide statistics.

This repo contains two datasets (clips->.mp4 files and joints -> .npy files) of basketball single-player actions. In Figure below, a histogram of the number of examples is shown for every class. The size of the two final annotated datasets is about 32'560 examples, which can represent the basis for the subsequent training and testing phases for a classification of basket-like actions through Deep Neural Networks.



You can download the entire Dataset (both joints and clips) from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hLpbLmLFK2-GIvsmpJelGlEx94yQM2Ts).
Inside ```dataset.zip``` you can find the annotations of all examples and labels annotations, both in JSON format.

Each example of the first dataset (called clip Dataset) consists of 16frame in RGB focused on one player, while each of the second (called joint Dataset) consists of the coordinates (x, y) on the image plane of the player's joints. The identifier of ""parallel"" examples will be the same, while what identifies them is the extension of the files on which they are stored; each clip is compressed into a mp4 file (namefile.mp4), while the joints are stored as sufile vectors numpy (namefile.npy).

To crawl a full season you need to use match_generator script. 
```
  python match_generator.py --league nba --seasons 2003-2004
  python match_generator.py --league nba --seasons 2003-to-2015 (will crawl every season from 2003 to 2015)
  python match_generator.py --league ncaa --seasons 2006-2007 2007-2008
```  

Individual matches are represented as a json in which every information from basketball-reference is scraped, including essential information for safely identifying players

31,gmf05/nba,Jupyter Notebook,"# Scripts to scrape and analyze basketball data.

Scripts scrape NBA.com, Sports Illustrated, etc. and analyze the resulting data.

Newest data collection scripts pull JSON (using the requests module) via the NBA API. For instance, this block of Python code saves data for the first game of the 2014-15 regular season:

    import bb_tools as bb
    gameid = '0021400001'
    bb.write_game_json(gameid) # save to disk (not necessary, but faster)
    box = bb.get_boxscore(gameid) # read from disk -- or web if not saved 
    pbp = bb.get_pbp(gameid)
    shots = bb.get_shots(gameid)
  
Data read/write paths are set in bb_tools.py.

The NBA's Game ID, 0021400001, is a 10-digit code: XXXYYGGGGG, where XXX refers to a season prefix, YY is the season year (e.g. 14 for 2014-15), and GGGGG refers to the game number (1-1230 for a full 30-team regular season).

Season prefixes are...

    001 : Pre Season
    002 : Regular Season
    003 : All-Star
    004 : Post Season

To save all data for the current season, run the following from the command line:

    python nbaupdate.py

To save data from previous seasons, you can pass an entire list of games. For example, the list of regular season games from 1996-97 to 2014-15 is provided in the repo.

    gamelist = bb.REPOHOME + '/data/csv/games_96-14.csv'
    bb.write_gamelist_json(gamelist)

=======

Older data collection scripts parse HTML (using modules re, BeautifulSoup, etc.) into CSV and include:

1. nbagames.py : Given a range of dates & season code (e.g. 00214 = 2014-15 regular season), formulates a text list of all NBA games in the range. [REPLACED BY savegames.py]

2. nbascores.py : Given a list of games, queries NBA.com and writes box score data for each one. Also can query vegasinsider.com to get moneyline odds for each game. [REPLACED BY savejson.py]

3. nbaplays.py : Given a list of games, queries NBA.com and writes play-by-play data for each one. [REPLACED BY savejson.py]

4. nbastats.py : Given a list of play-by-play data, convert certain events (shots attempted/made, fouls, turnovers) into point process data (i.e. list of binary outcomes over time [0 0 0 0 1 ...]) [REPLACED BY parse_possession.py]

=======

Analysis scripts apply machine learning techniques to the resulting data in Python, Matlab, and R. Some simple examples are shown in IPython Notebooks.

This repository contains the PyTorch code for [ICPR 2020](https://www.micc.unifi.it/icpr2020/) paper:

**<a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12661v2"">DAG-Net: Double Attentive Graph Neural Network for Trajectory Forecasting</a>**  
*<a href=""https://github.com/alexmonti19"">Alessio Monti</a>,
<a href=""https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/person.asp?idpersona=110"">Alessia Bertugli</a>,

<a href=""https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/person.asp?idpersona=1"">Rita Cucchiara</a>*  

## Model architecture
The model is composed by three main components: the generative model (VRNN) and two graph neural networks.

![dagnet - overview](icpr.png)
 
The first graph network operates on agents' goals, expressed as specific areas of the environment where agents 
will land in the future. The second second graph network operates instead on single agents' hidden states, 
which contain past motion behavioural information. The employing of two separate graph neural networks allows to consider 
and share both past and future information while generating agents' future movements.


## Prerequisites

* Python >= 3.8
* PyTorch >= 1.5
* CUDA 10.0

### Installation

* Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexmonti19/dagnet.git
cd dagnet
```

* Create a new virtual environment using Conda or virtualenv. 
```
conda create --name <envname>
```
* Activate the environment and install the requirements:
```
conda activate <envname>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
Our proposal is general enough to be applied in different scenarios: the model achieves state-of-the-art results in both
urban environments (*Stanford Drone Dataset*) and sports applications (*STATS SportVU NBA Dataset*).   

For complete information on where to download and how to preprocess the datasets see the relative 
[datasets/README.md](./datasets/README.md).

## Architectures
The repo contains both the final model and the two ablation architectures cited in the paper.
- *VRNN*: the baseline generative architecture
- *A-VRNN*: enhanced version of the baseline with a single graph (on agents' hidden states)
- *DAG-Net*: the complete architecture with two graphs

For more information on how to train the models see the relative [models/README.md](./models/README.md).

## Pre-trained models
We also ship the checkpoints to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## AI Basketball Shot Detection and Analysis
This program is able to detect when a shot occurs and fill in the balls flight from captured data. It calculates the balls initial velocity and launch angle. It is able to estimate the balls flight perpedicular to the camera plane (The z axis) using a single camera. The program is also able to detect when the balls flight is interupted by another object and will drop those data points.

## Tracking and analysis performed on

36,andrewstellman/pbprdf,HTML,"# pbprdf
Generate RDF for NBA or WNBA basketball play-by-play data by reading a folder full of ESPN-style play-by-play HTML pages (eg. [Pacers vs. Cavaliers, April 15, 2018](http://tv5.espn.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=401029417) or [Mystics vs. Sun, June 5, 2015](http://scores.espn.go.com/wnba/playbyplay?gameId=400610636)), processing each play in each game file, and generating a Turtle file that contains all of the plays from each game.

Here's an article by that explains gives some more detail about the project: *[NBA analytics and RDF graphs: Game, data, and metadata evolution, and Occam's razor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nba-analytics-and-rdf-graphs-game-data-and-metadata-evolution-and-occams-razor/)*

Here's an example of an analysis that you can do with pbprdf: *[Analysis: 3-point shot percentage after other team makes or misses](https://gist.github.com/andrewstellman/4872dbb9dc7593e56abddbe8b998b509)*

## Running pbprdf

To run pbprdf, download the latest release from the Releases page: https://github.com/andrewstellman/pbprdf/releases and make sure Java 8 or later is in your path.

The release distribution contains an archive with the following files:
* `pbprdf.jar` - the binary
* `pbprdf` - Mac/Unix shell script to run pbprdf
* `pbprdf.bat` - Windows batch file to run pbprdf
* shell scripts to fetch WNBA or NBA play-by-play files

### Example: Analyze a set of games

Step 1: Download a set of play-by-play HTML files
```
$ ./fetch-wnba-play-by-plays.sh
```

This will create a folder called `data/retrieved_*` (with a timestamp at the end of the folder name) with subdirectories for various seasons and playoffs. Move the folder for a season or playoff into the current folder (in this example, the folder with the 2014 playoffs):

```
$ mv data/retrieved_*/wnba-2018-playoffs .
```

Step 2: Run pbprdf and generate the Turtle file for the 2014 WNBA playoffs
```
$ ./pbprdf wnba-2018-playoffs/ wnba-2018-playoffs.ttl
```

Step 3: Import the Turtle file into RDF4J Server
*(see instructions at the bottom for spinning up an RDF4J server, loading data into it, and connecting to it with the RDF4J console)
```
$ console -s http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server pbprdf-database
Type 'help' for help.
pbprdf-database> load wnba-2014-playoffs.ttl into http://stellman-greene.com/pbprdf/wnba-2014-playoffs
Loading data...
Data has been added to the repository (20410 ms)
```

If your file is large, you can use zip or gzip to compress it. Make sure it has the extension `.ttl.zip`:

```
$ ./fetch-nba-play-by-plays.sh
$ ./pbprdf data/nba-2017-2018-season/ nba-2017-2018-season.ttl
$ zip nba-2017-2018-season.ttl.zip nba-2017-2018-season.ttl
$ console -s http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server pbprdf-database
Type 'help' for help.
pbprdf-database> load nba-2017-2018-season.ttl.zip into http://stellman-greene.com/pbprdf/nba-2017-2018
Loading data...
Data has been added to the repository (427100 ms)
```

__See 'Setting up RDF4J Server' below for details on setting up RDF4J server__

Step 4: Run SPARQL queries
```
pbprdf-database> SPARQL
enter multi-line SPARQL query (terminate with line containing single '.')
BASE <http://stellman-greene.com/>
SELECT ?teamName (COUNT(*) AS ?foulsDrawn) WHERE { 
  ?fouledPlayer pbprdf:foulDrawnBy ?player .
  ?roster pbprdf:hasPlayer ?player .
  ?roster rdfs:label ?teamName .
}
GROUP BY ?teamName
ORDER BY ?foulsDrawn
.

BASE <http://stellman-greene.com/>
PREFIX pbprdf: <#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
```


### Example: Load the ontology into RDF4J Server

Step 1: Generate the ontology
```
$ ./pbprdf --ontology ontology.ttl
```

Step 2: Load the ontology into its own context
```
pbprdf-database> load ontology.ttl into http://stellman-greene.com/pbprdf/ontology
Loading data...
Data has been added to the repository (18 ms)
```

Step 3: Execute a query that retrieves only the data in the ontology
```

## Setting up RDF4J Server

One effective way to execute SPARQL queries against these files is to use [RDF4J Server, Workbench, and Console](http://docs.rdf4j.org/server-workbench-console/). RDF4J Server and its GUI, RDF Workbench, are both web applications that run in an application server like Tomcat.

__Step 1: [Download RDF4J](http://rdf4j.org/download/)__

Download and extract the latest RDF4J SDK. It will contain a `bin` folder with the `console` binary, and a `war` folder with the `rdf4j-server.war` and `rdf4j-workbench.war` web applications.

__Step 2: [Install Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/installation.html)__

This usually just involves downloading and extracting the Tomcat binaries, editing libexec/conf/tomcat-users.xml to add a user with `tomcat` and `manager-gui` permissions, and executing `catalina run` to start the server.

__Step 3: Open the Apache Tomcat App Manager (http://localhost:8080/manager/html) and deploy the web applications__

Use the app manager GUI to deploy the `rdf4j-server.war` and `rdf4j-workbench.war` web applications to your Tomcat installations.

__Step 4: Use the RDF4J console to create a database__

Create a Native database with `spoc`,`sopc`,`opsc`,`ospc`,`posc`, and `psoc` indexes. This will take disk space for the indexes, but will make your queries run much faster.

```
$ cd eclipse-rdf4j-2.3.2/bin/
$ ./console.sh -s http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server 
Connected to http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server
RDF4J Console 2.3.2+496af9c

2.3.2+496af9c
Type 'help' for help.
> create native-rdfs
Please specify values for the following variables:
Repository ID [native]: pbprdf-database
Repository title [Native store with RDF Schema inferencing]: PBPRDF Database
Query Iteration Cache size [10000]: 
Triple indexes [spoc,posc]: spoc,sopc,opsc,ospc,posc,psoc
EvaluationStrategyFactory [org.eclipse.rdf4j.query.algebra.evaluation.impl.StrictEvaluationStrategyFactory]: 
Repository created
> open pbprdf-database
Opened repository 'pbprdf-database'
pbprdf-database> 
```

__Step 5: Import your Turtle file__
You can use the instructions above to import your `*.ttl` or `*.ttl.zip` files into your newly created database. You can either use the RDF4J console or RDF4J workbench GUI to execute SPARQL queries.

38,octonion/basketball,PLpgSQL,"The shell script ""demo.sh"" loads scraped data alias tables
between the two data sets (NCAA and Basketball Reference)
for schools and players. It then runs sample R code that does
a simple stepwise regression to detect some NCAA features
that impact NBA playing time 1 year out from the draft.

You won't be able to run these without installing PostgreSQL,
R etc., but I've included two text files showing the results. The
first is ""script_output.txt"" which shows the output of the ""demo.sh""
script (including the total time take - about 12 seconds).

The file ""feature_selection.txt"" shows the results of the stepwise
regression.

This is the final model - no surprise, the pick number dominates
in a non-linear way. Also settled on were height, position, games,
assists per game and steals per game. I did not examine any
interaction terms, nor did I look at other measures of NBA value,
but these are straightforward given the database (up to the
limitations of my scraped data, of course).

I haven't adjusted college performance for NCAA strength of
schedule yet.

41,virajsanghvi/d3.basketball-shot-chart,HTML,"# d3.basketball-shot-chart

This visualization aims to become a generic means of generating charts on a basketball court. Currently it only supports hexbin shot charts, with lots of flexibility, but is alpha quality and will be refactored to support other binning mechanisms and other mark types on top of a basketball court.

Currently customizable:

- Court dimensions/lines
- Binning definition
- Hexagon size range and color range
- Integrating different shot chart datasets
- Titles and labels

## Setup

- Include ```d3.js```
- Include ```hexbin.js``` [d3.hexbin](https://github.com/virajsanghvi/d3-plugins/tree/master/hexbin) - NOTE: this is a fork
- Include ```d3.chart.js``` - [d3.chart](http://misoproject.com/d3-chart/)
- Include ```d3.chart.defaults.js``` [d3.chart.defaults](https://github.com/virajsanghvi/d3.chart.defaults)
- Include ```d3.basketball-shot-chart.js```
- Include ```d3.basketball-shot-chart.css``` (or include the sass file)

## Examples

This library is currently used to generate the shot charts at [tothemean](http://tothemean.com/tools/shot-charts), and there's a [blog post that walks through using this chart](FIXME).

If you clone the repo, you'll also find a simple example in the ```example``` directory.

## To use:

Generally, you likely have some shot chart data that's an array of data points representing shots, including the x, y position on the court, and whether the shot was made: 

```
  var data = [{""x"":2,""y"":9,""made"":1},{""x"":2,""y"":8,""made"":1},...];
```

You can continue with this, or you can also self aggregate to reduce the size/complexity of the data, and capture number of makes and attempts at a location:

```
  var data = [{""x"":2,""y"":9,""made"":3,""attempts"":3},{""x"":2,""y"":8,""made"":0,""attempts"":4},...];
```

NOTE: Even in this scheme, a point for the same location can be repeated, as all points will be aggregated as part of the binning process (which is how we handle the first simple case).

Once we have our data, we can quickly chart it:

```javascript
  var chart = d3.select(el)
    .append(""svg"")
    .chart(""BasketballShotChart"")
      .draw(data); 
```

By default, the shot chart visualization recognizes the data structure above, but that can easily be configured with the options below. Also, by default, the heat chart is based on a range of shooting 0% to 100%. Most shot charts you've probably seen compare to the average, and its up to you to calculate that, but you can use the options below to update the range of values for the heatMap, and to make the hexagon colors or radiuses based on any value from your data you want.

# Options

You can pass any of these options when creating a new chart. You can change them through public setters, but the shot chart won't autoimically pick them up - yet.

These are all defined in the code, and I recommend looking there for more information on how they're actually utilized.

# 2. Use AI Basketball Games Video Editor

## 2.1 Prepare your basketball video
- download your basketball video in the directory `dataset/`

## 2.2 Prepare output folder
- `mkdir result`

## 2.3 Run the demo
```sh
python video_editor.py --video_path VIDEO_PATH --output_path OUTPUT_PATH --output_video_name OUTPUT_VIDEO_NAME [OPTIONS]

# example
python video_editor.py --video_path dataset/basketball_demo.mp4 --output_path result/demo --output_video_name out_demo.mp4
```

- It will generate `your_output_video_name.mp4 obj_log_name.data` in the directory `result/`

- If you had finished extracting features. You can use `--read_flag 1` to read log for different output video mode. 

- If you use pytorch yolov4 object detector engine `--inference_detector pytorch`.  
  For image input size, you can select any inference_size = (height, width) in   
  height = 320 + 96 * n, n in {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  
  width = 320 + 96 * m, m in {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}  
  Exmaple `--inference_size (1184, 1184)` or `--inference_size (704, 704)`  
  Default inference_size is (1184, 1184)
  
- If you use tensorrt yolov4 object detector engine `--inference_detector tensorrt`.  
  For image input size, you only can select `--inference_size (1184, 1184)`.  
  Tensorrt engine 3x faster than pytorch engine fps.

- You can use `--output_mode shot` to select different output video mode.
  ```
  output video mode  
  full            show person basketball basketball_hoop frame_information  
  basketball      show basketball basketball_hoop frame_information  
  shot            show basketball shot frame_information  
  standard        show frame_information  
  clean           only cutting video

###NOTE THIS DOCUMENTATION IS SLIGHTLY OUTDATED FOLLOWING THE LATEST PACKAGE UPDATE 1/13

`bigballR` is an R package for working with NCAA Basketball data. This 
package primarily revolves around the use of schedule, roster, and play-by-play data via stats.ncaa.com, and
additionally has features to calculate lineups, on/off results, and player game and multi-game statistics.

## Installation

First install the package `devtools` if you haven't already
``` r
#install.packages(""devtools"")
devtools::install_github(""jflancer/bigballR"")
```

## Functionality

**Retrieving Game IDs and Other Information**

Manually, game ids can be found in the url when browsing games, for example:
```4674164``` is the game id for ```https://stats.ncaa.org/game/play_by_play/4674164```

- `get_date_games` data frame with game info and game ids for a given date.
- `get_team_schedule` data frame with game info and ids for a given team.
- `get_team_roster` data frame with player roster information for a given team. 

**Game Scraping Functions**
- `scrape_game` the base function, given a game id will return a cleaned play by play file.
- `get_play_by_play` builds off of scrape_game, allows for compiling from multiple game ids formatted in a vector.

**Data Manipulation Functions**
- `get_lineups` given play-by-play data retrieved from game scraping functions, will calculate a variety of stats for all lineups.
- `on_off_generator` calculate on/off statistics for specified players given lineup data from get_lineups().
- `get_player_stats` calculate a variety of player stats from play-by-play data at either a game or multi-game level.
- `get_player_lineups` acts as an easy way to filter lineup data, specifying players to exclude/include from the lineups.

**Datasets**
- `teamids` dataset includes stats.ncaa team name, team conference, season, and team id for 17-18 and 18-19 seasons

### Use

There are many different progressions and ways to use this package. As an example, here are some natural steps you could take.
``` r
# Get team schedule
# Note: if you don't know the proper team.name (case sensitive), you can look it up in data(""teamids"")
schedule <- get_team_schedule(season = ""2018-19"", team.name = ""Duke"")
# Get play by play for all games played so far in season
play_by_play <- get_play_by_play(schedule$Game_ID)
# Generate all lineups and stats from the play by play
lineups <- get_lineups(play_by_play_data = play_by_play, keep.dirty = T, garbage.filter = F)
# Look at Zion Williamson's on/off statistics with lineups that include Reddish and Barrett
zion_comparison <- on_off_generator(""ZION.WILLIAMSON"", lineups, Included = c(""CAM.REDDISH"",""RJ.BARRETT""))
```

### `scrape_game` / `get_play_by_play`
Functions to retrieve play by play data. scrape_game() works for individual games while get_play_by_play can handle a vector of gameids and will aggregate into a single dataframe. Warns users of potential errors and mistakes made by the game trackers. The number of player discrepancies warning counts displays the number of events players committed when it is found they were not on the court at the time of the event. The substitution mistake warning indicates an unclean substitution was entered. (ex. 2 players enter and 1 leaves)
* game_id | string made up of digits given to each unique game. This can be found in the play-by-play url for each game.
* game_ids | same function as above, but can handle character vectors of any length.

### `get_date_games`
This function returns a schedule for the given date and specified conference. Results are included if applicable, as well as the play-by-play game id
* date | a character object containing a date in the format mm/dd/yyyy. Defaults is previous day (yesterday)
* conference | the common name used for a conference, not sensitive to case, spacing, punctuation, etc.
* conference.ID | alternatively, if the conference ID is known it replace the conference name variable.

### `get_team_schedule`
This function returns a data frame of the schedule for the specified team. This will include game ids used for play-by-play scraping if the game has ended, along with the team scores and attendance. Note: currently, the season/team.name parameters can only be used for the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 seasons.
* team.id | The unique id given to each college/team for each season. This can be found in the url of the team page.
* season | Season following format yyy1-y2, ex ""2018=19""
* team.name | Alternative to using the id, you can use a team name. This follows the format found in data(ids).

### `get_team_roster`
This function returns a data frame of the roster for the specified team. This will include player names and positions as well as jersey number, height and school year. Note: currently, the season/team.name parameters can only be used for the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 seasons.
* This takes the same parameters and conditions as get_team_schedule() above

### `get_lineups`
This function takes in a play-by-play dataframe, and generates all possible lineups for both teams. It then calculates a variety of statistics/metrics at a lineup level.
* play_by_play_data | play-by-play data from the functions scrape_game() or get_play_by_play()
* keep.dirty | logical to specify whether or not to filter out potentially inaccurrate data. When FALSE, will remove all rows from games where the number of discrepencies is above the desired count.
* garbage.filter | logical variable to specify whether or not to filter out garbage time entries.
* error.thresh | lets user set their preferred discrepancy threshold with the keep.dirty variable. This means when less than the threshold occurs in a game, it will be considered clean. As defined in scrape_game(), a discrepancy occurs when a player registers an event when they are not found to be on the court.

### `on_off_generator`
This function passes in lineup data and calculates the on/off lineup statistics for all lineup combinations of players specified. This allows users to view on/off statistics for individual players, as well as combinations of multiple players. Users can also specify if they'd like specific players to be included or excluded from all lineups in use
* Players | players desired to be compared with on/off
* Lineup_Data | lineups collected from the get_lineups() function
* Included These Players will be on the court for every lineup considered.
* Excluded These players will be off the court for every lineup considered.

### `get_player_lineups`
This function finds all lineups from a given lineup data source that include/exclude certain players. It acts as a quick way to filter lineups for players.
* Takes same parameters as on_off_generator() with exception to the Players parameter

### `get_player_stats`
This function calculates many player stats for either individual games or aggregate to get multi-game stats.
* Takes all parameters described in get_lineups() function
* multi.games | When false stats will be calculated on a game level. When true all games will be aggregated.

DATA:
Right now, only the aggregate data is really being used.  To check that 
you can load the data properly, run

> python march_madness_data.py

this should output the following:
Skipped 1426 entries due to UNK
After loading simple data
2006-2007: 5125 games
2007-2008: 5248 games
2008-2009: 5332 games
2009-2010: 5363 games
After removing tournament games
2006-2007: 5047 games
2007-2008: 5161 games
2008-2009: 5237 games
2009-2010: 5269 games

So it loaded about 5000 games from each of 4 past seasons.  

If you'd like to dig into the full data, look for 

def load_full_data(self):

in march_madness_data.py.


BRACKET:
We don't have data that specifically identifies which games were a part 
of the tournament, so we do it programmatically.  Most of the code is
called automatically when you make a MarchMadnessData object.  To see the
results, you can run

> python bracket.py

This should output the filled-in tournament bracket for previous seasons.
It should look like this:

2008-2009

LEARNING:
There is also starter code for learning, but this is still in progress.

The simplest thing to try is to run

> python learn_synthetic.py

This will run learning with the simplest model, on synthetic data.  The first run
will take a bit longer at startup, because theano is doing the symbolic differentiation.


You can then move on to

> python learn_real.py

This will learn, but on the real data now.  This code is not finished, but it should be
enough structure to get you started.

In model.py, you can see three different models, of increasing level of complexity.  You
can select between these in the learn_*.py scripts.


Some TODOs for the ambitious:

- Load the full data and verify it against the aggregate data.

- Set up a proper validation/testing framework, so we can evaluate different methods
  properly.  Perhaps we want to do leave-one-out cross validation.

- Try different objective functions in the theano models -- what do we actually
  want to optimize?

- Think about how to better include pace of the game

- Improve the optimization (maybe using momentum, LBFGS, or conjugate gradients?)"

Hello Everyone, This project talks about basics of ARKit introduced by Apple in iOS11. Please note that ARKit is only capable wih 
devices which use A9, A10, A11 chips and the devices that use these chips are:

a) iPhone 6s and 6s Plus 
b) iPhone 7 and 7 Plus 
c) iPhone SE
d) iPad Pro (9.7, 10.5 or 12.9) – both first-gen and 2nd-gen
e) iPad (2017)
f) iPhone 8 and 8 Plus
g) iPhone X

Now coming to the project, it shows how to build a basic BasketBall app using ARKit. Taking it step by step:

PS: Please note that we have to choose Augmented Reality App as template when you create the project.

1) Camera Permission:

This step involves asking for permission from user for his Camera access. This can be done by adding 'Privacy - Camera Usage Description : This application will use the camera for Augmented Reality' as key-value in pair in info.plist

2) Adding the hoop:

After you launch the app, you just see the world infront of you through phone's camera. Now you can augment a Basketball hoop by just adding the code below:

```
func addBackboard(){
        guard  let backboardScene = SCNScene(named:""art.scnassets/hoop.scn"") else{return}
        guard let backboardNode = backboardScene.rootNode.childNode(withName: ""backboard"", recursively: false) else{return}
        backboardNode.position = SCNVector3(x:0.0, y:0.5, z:-3)
        
        let physicsShape = SCNPhysicsShape(node: backboardNode, options: [SCNPhysicsShape.Option.type : SCNPhysicsShape.ShapeType.concavePolyhedron])
        let physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .static, shape: physicsShape)
        backboardNode.physicsBody = physicsBody
        
        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(backboardNode)
        currentNode = backboardNode
    }
```

<img width=""462"" alt=""screen shot 2017-12-11 at 1 55 52 pm"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21070922/33821763-1db1e81e-de7b-11e7-8ac2-16fe006176b0.png"">


Then we add a Tap Gesture onto the SceneView to aim the ball at the basket. 

```
func registerTapGestureRecogniser(){
        let tap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap(gesture:)))
        sceneView.addGestureRecognizer(tap)
    }
    
    @objc func handleTap(gesture:UIRotationGestureRecognizer){
        //scene view to be accessed
        //access the center point of the sceneview
        guard let sceneView = gesture.view as? ARSCNView else{return}
        guard let centerPoint = sceneView.pointOfView else{return}
        
        let cameraTransform = centerPoint.transform
        let cameraLocation = SCNVector3(x:cameraTransform.m41, y: cameraTransform.m42, z:cameraTransform.m43)
        let cameraOrientation = SCNVector3(x: -cameraTransform.m31, y: -cameraTransform.m32, z: -cameraTransform.m33)
        let cameraPosition = SCNVector3Make(cameraLocation.x + cameraOrientation.x, cameraLocation.y + cameraOrientation.y , cameraLocation.z + cameraOrientation.z)
        
        let ball = SCNSphere()
        let material = SCNMaterial()
        material.diffuse.contents = UIImage(named:""basketballSkin.png"")
        ball.materials = [material]
        
        let ballNode = SCNNode(geometry:ball)
        ballNode.position = cameraPosition
        
        let physcisShape = SCNPhysicsShape(geometry: ball, options: nil)
        let physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .dynamic, shape: physcisShape)
        
        ballNode.physicsBody = physicsBody
        let forceVector:Float = 6
        ballNode.physicsBody?.applyForce(SCNVector3(x:cameraOrientation.x * forceVector, y:cameraOrientation.y * forceVector, z: cameraOrientation.z * forceVector), asImpulse:true)
        
        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(ballNode)
        
    }
```

>diffuse property of SCNMaterial deals with how light is rendered on the material and contents property deals with the actual parents of the material

Optional:

Moving objects in AR Space is really straight forward. Here I am posting two methods to move the hoop in XY plane in a horizontal and circuit manner:

```
func horizontalAction (node:SCNNode){
        let leftAction = SCNAction.move(by: SCNVector3(x:-1, y:0, z:0), duration: 2)
        let rightAction = SCNAction.move(to: SCNVector3(x:1, y:0, z:0), duration: 2)
        let actionSequence = SCNAction.sequence([leftAction , rightAction])
        node.runAction(SCNAction.repeat(actionSequence, count: 2))
    }
 ```
 
 ```
 func roundAction(node:SCNNode){
        let upright = SCNAction.move(by: SCNVector3(x:1, y:1, z:0), duration: 2)
        let downright = SCNAction.move(to: SCNVector3(x:1, y:-1, z:0), duration: 2)
        let downLeft = SCNAction.move(by: SCNVector3(x:-1, y:-1, z:0), duration: 2)
        let upLeft = SCNAction.move(to: SCNVector3(x:-1, y:1, z:0), duration: 2)
        let actionSequence = SCNAction.sequence([upright , downright , downLeft , upLeft])
        node.runAction(SCNAction.repeat(actionSequence, count: 2))
    }
 ```

The user specifies ```teams``` (from best seed to worst seed), along with a vector of ```seeds```. Note that after games have been played, the ```seeds``` vector must be entered in the order of highest possible seed for each given slot. For example, if we have quarterfinals where the matchups are 1 vs. 9, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 14, and 4 vs. 12, we'd set ```seeds``` = (1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 7, 9), as 5, 6, 7, 8 are the ""chalk"" seeds occupied by 12, 14, 7, and 9 in this hypothetical 15 team tournament. The user must also enter the number of single ```byes```, the number of ```double_byes```, the number of simulations to run ```nsims```, and a parameter for home court advantage, ```hca```. If the tournament is played at a neutral site, set ```hca = NA```. If the higher seed is always given home court advantage, set ```hca = ""seed""```. If one team hosts the tournament (even if not the top seed), set ```hca = INSERT_TEAM_NAME```.

Men's College Basketball Play by Play Data

__NOTE:__ As of 8/8/2018, the majority of functionality, including development of Play-by-Play scrapers, assist networks, and 
win probability charts has moved to my new R package, [ncaahoopR](https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR). Data and other miscellaneous
files will still be stored here, but core scripts whose functionally has been incorporated into the  ```ncaahoopR``` package will be updated with the package, not in this repository.



__NCAA_Hoops_PBP_Scraper.R:__ An R file used to scrape data from ESPN. The following functions are available.

* ```get_pbp(team)```: Game entire 2017-18 Season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team.
* ```get_pbp_game(gameIDS)```:  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of ESPN game ids. 
* ```get_roster(team)```: Get a particular team's roster. 
* ```get_schedule(team)```: Get a team's schedule.
* ```get_game_ids(team)```: Get a vector of ESPN Game IDs for all games in which ```team``` plays in.
* ```get_date(gameID)```: Gets the date of a game given an ESPN Game ID.
* ```is.nit(gameID)```: Returns logical ```T/F``` whether or not the game was part of the NIT

Note that team names must adhere to ESPN naming conventions. A full dictionary of team names used by ESPN is provided in __ids.csv__  Note that play by play data is not available for all games.

__pbp_2016_17/:__ A folder containing play by play csv files for each team for the 2016-17 season. Additionally, the file [all_games.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzSws2ZDOraxbXF0aWNJNmxCdnM) (too large for GitHub) contains all games scraped for the 2016-17 season. Each team's .csv file contains the following variables:
   * __play_id__: The index of a play in a given game
   * __half:__ Overtimes denoted by 3, 4, etc.
   * __time_remaining_half:__ Time left in a given period of play, as it would appear on a scoreboard.
   * __secs_remaining:__ The number of seconds left in a given game.
   * __description:__ A description of what happened on the given play.
   * __home_score/away_score:__ Scores for the home and away teams, as denoted by ESPN. Even for neutral site games, a ""home team"" is denoted by choosing the team listed second in ESPN box scores.
   * __away/home:__ Home and Away teams. See above for treatment of neutral site games.
   * __home_favored_by:__ Number of points the home team is favored by, if available. (i.e. 6 corresponds with traditional Vegas line of -6.0)
   
__pbp_2017_18/:__ Same as above for 2017-18 season.

__Assist_Network.R:__ The function ```assist_net(team, node_col, season, rmv_bench)```, used to create college basketball assist networks. 
  * ```team``` is the ESPN team name
  * ```node_col``` is the node color for the graph
  * ```season```: Options include ""2016-17"", ""2017-18"", or a vector of ESPN game IDs. 
  * ```rmv_bench```: Logical. If TRUE, removes all players who aren't in the network. 
  * ```tree```: Logical. If TRUE, draws graph in tree structure. If FALSE, draws graph in circle
  * ```three_weights```: Logical. If TRUE, assisted three point shots are given 1.5 weight. If FALSE, assisted three point shots are given weight 1. In both cases, assisted 2 point shots are given weight 1. 
  * ```Message``` (default = ```NA```) Option for custom message to replace graph title when using a subset of the season (e.g. conference play).
  
__rosters_2016_17/:__ 2016-17 rosters for each team.

__rosters_2017_18/:__ 2017-18 rosters for each team.

Requires [all_games.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzSws2ZDOraxbXF0aWNJNmxCdnM) and [2017_18_mid_season.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b7P-p1loGIghL0zDpzaox255X93Mqgkg/view?usp=sharing).

__wp_charts.R:/__ Plots win probability chart for given game. Usage:```wp_chart(ESPN_Game_ID, home_color, away_color, show_legend = T)```. The ```show_legend``` parameter is defaulted to ```TRUE```. I recommend turning this parameter off when plotting more than one win probability charts on a single graph.

__shiny_app:/__ Code for the [R Shiny App version of Assist Networks](https://lbenz730.shinyapps.io/assist_networks).

__network_metric_leaders.R:__ A script for computing weighted/unweighted assist network metrics for all 351 Division 1 teams. The mid-season leaderboad for the 2017-18 season is stored in __1_2_2018_assist_leaderboard.csv__. 

__kenpom_scraper.R:__ Scrapes data from [kenpom.com](https://kenpom.com) main page and store results in __kenpom.csv__.

### A Machine Learning system to guide your March Madness bracket.

A Machine Learning project providing a solution to the Google Cloud & NCAA® Machine Learning Competition 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2019).

The project provides a solution to both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the Kaggle competition, predicting the winner of historical fixtures and predicting the winners of all possible March Madness 2019 matchups respectively. 

The submission files for these solutions can be found in 'SubmissionStage1.csv' and 'SubmissionStage2.csv' respectively. The project predicts the probability that the first team specified will beat the second team specified for each matchup listed in the Sample Submission file for both Stage 1 and Stage 2.

The project also creates a predicted bracket for the 2019 NCAA Men's March Madness basketball tournament based on the predictions made in Stage 2, and uses the tournament seedings and slots. This bracket can be found in the file 'output.png'.

**NCAA 2019 Tournament Predictions:** \
<img src = ""bracket.png""/>


**Reflection on the Competition, the Model and the Results:** \
With March Madness 2019 now over, I thought it would be a great time to reflect on my first time entering Google's competition, which saw entries from some of the leading universities and academic teams in the world. So, let's get to it.
* In terms of its simplicity to implement, the model turned out to be decent. It predicted the right winner of each matchup that occurred in this tournament with an accuracy of about 78%, which isn't too bad. Better still, it was able to predict the correct winner of the entire tournament - the Virginia Cavaliers. This indicates that it did, to an extend, understand what was important in winning - in the case of Virginia, it seemed to be great defense and solid three-point shooting (which is probably why the model didn't even predict pre-tournament favourites Duke to make the finals).
* The main flaw that I saw in the model was the fact that it did not take seedings into account. While the seeding would be the basis for most people's predictions in fixtures, as there tends to be a relatively strong correlation between the higher seed and the winning team, my model did not consider the seeding of the two teams in a matchup. This resulted in the model often making extremely risky predictions that were purely stats-based - I believe that the imposition of the seedings of the two teams will reduce the number of these risky predictions. The reason why it was difficult to incorporate seedings into the model was that the large majority of training data was from regular NCAA matches rather than the March Madness Championships. The large majority of teams playing in these NCAA matches, however, do not ever get assigned a seed - this is because they do not qualify for the Championships  itself. To get around this issue, I plan to utilize seedings in future predictive models with one slight tweak - I would assign a seeding of 16, which is the lowest possible seed in the Championships, to all teams that do not end up ever getting a seed. This indicates that they would be the weakest in the pool of teams if they qualified the Championships, which is valid given that they did not even make it.
* Another shortcoming of the model, in my eyes, was that it didn't consider any of the previous matchups between the two teams considered. Head-to-head is usually a pretty good indicative of which team will win, since it is derived from experience. Adding this in future editions shouldn't be too difficult - it'll just require a data point that represents the yearly matchup details between two teams.
* The project largely focused on the data side of the model, so little time was spent on optimizing the model - only a GridSearch was applied for the neural network. Optimization is, however, a clear distinguishing factor between average and great models. In order to improve on this next year, I would have to spend more time reading about about the latest advancements in the domain, and apply techniques that generate improvements which optimize the model. This may, however, require the implementation of techniques from new research papers.

62,arbues6/BueStats,Python,"# 0. BueStats
Advanced statistics have proven to be a crucial tool for basketball coaches in order to improve training skills. Indeed, the performance of the team can be further optimized by studying the behaviour of players under certain conditions, thus NBA teams already created highly skilled data science departments to handle tons of information, such as tracking data or the output of other advanced computer vision algorithms. However, European teams are far behind in this field, and tracking data is completely otherworldly for the 97% of them, but the worst thing is that there is not an existing culture-data tradition, which creates the need for data. Coaches have a solid point when they say that their job includes not only practice preparation, but also video sessions, individual meetings, or even physical and conditioning stuff, so they have basically no time to start digging for data for a rough analysis a posteriori. 
The goal of BueStats is fulfilling these couple of gaps:
1. Provide coaches with a basic tool that automatically extracts advanced-statistics reports. 
2. Help coaches understand and handle data in order to create a natural habit. Reports' data will not have complex information, but game conditioning factors and metrics that are easy to understand (tutorials are coming soon!), as it is important to establish a solid numerical basis before moving forward. 

In particular, at the moment, BueStats can provide advanced statistics reports of FEB teams (Spanish Basketball Federation), which include any team/player from: 
- **Liga Femenina Endesa** (1st female Spanish division)
- **Leb Oro** (2nd male Spanish division)
- **Liga Femenina 2** (2nd female Spanish division)
- **Leb Plata** (3rd male Spanish division)
- **Liga EBA** (4th male Spanish division)

BueStats is a non-lucrative Python-based project out of the scope of my PhD, and it has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04, MacOS 10.15.2 and Windows 10. I really hope you like it! 

## 1. Requirements
### 1.a. ChromeDriver
BueStats does not only compute advanced basketball metrics, but it is also a web scraper that gets information from the HTML code of FEB websites (in a cool and legal way, of course). However, FEB's website is not that easy to scrap, given that there are dropdown menus that have to be changed, but these actions do not modify the general website link; for this reason, a remote browser controller has to be installed: [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/). It is vital to install a Chromedriver version that matches your Google Chrome browser version, which can be find in Settings, and clicking About Chrome. Once installed, make sure that the downloaded chromedriver exectuable file is placed in the main BueStats folder. 

### 1.b. Python Dependencies
As exepected, some Open-Source Python libraries have to be installed as well for a proper running of this program. This dependencies are included in *Requirements.txt* in case you want to build a virutal environment; otherwise, these libraries can be easily installed with pip: 
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install lxml
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install requests
pip3 install bs4
```

## 2. Interface
BueStats has a simple straight-forward interface (Stats_GUI) as seen in the following screenshot: 
![alt text](BueStats_Interface.png)
- **1. Team / Equipo:** target team you want to scout or analyze. The name of the team must be a **single unique word** with no spaces belonging the the team original name; this is, the name of the team according to FEB. In the given example, Melilla's data will be extracted; note that Melilla is a unique team name, whereas ""Baloncesto"" or ""Club"" would not be. 
- **2. Season / Temporada:** season you want to scout; in this case, 2018 indicates the 2018-2019 season (2019 would indicate 2019-2020 and so on). 
- **3. Division / Categoria:** FEB division of the corresponding team. In order to unify groups and names, and bearing in mind that the program is case-sensitive, the following nomenclature has to be followed: 
  - **3.a. Liga Femenina Endesa** can be written as *Endesa* or *LF*.
  - **3.b. Leb Oro** has to be written as *ORO*.
  - **3.c. Liga Femenina 2** has to be written as *LF2*, but given that there are 2 groups (A or B), the group must be included in the encoding after a comma: for example, *LF2,A* belongs to a team compeiting in the group A of Liga Femenina 2.
  - **3.d. Leb Plata** is by far the most complex one, as it has two competition phases: the first one is geographically defined (Este / Oeste), while the second one depends on the previous results (A2). For this reason, a basic encoding has to be followed: *PLATA,F1,F2* , where *F1* belongs to the first phase and can be *ESTE* or *OESTE*, and *F2* belongs to the second one and can be expressed as *A1* and *A2*. An example could be: *PLATA,ESTE,A1*, or *PLATA,OESTE,A2*. However, if you want to output data just from one phase, you should encode it as: *PLATA,F*, where *F* could be one of the mentioned options (*ESTE* / *OESTE* / *A1* / *A2*).  
  - **3.e. Liga EBA** has to be written as *EBA*, but as happened with Liga Femenina 2, the name of the group has to be included as well after a comma with either one or two characters: for instance, if the team plays in group C, which has division CA and division CB, the encoding would be *EBA,CA* or *EBA,CB*, but if the team plays in division B, which has no subdivisions, the encoding would be *EBA,B*.
- **4. First Round / Primera Jornada** is the first (included) round to be taken into account while extracting data.
- **5. Last Round / Última Jornada** is the last (included) round to be taken into account while extracting data.
- **6. Top Teams / Equipos Top** (optional) can be filled with the top teams of the competition, which might help to see how players perform against powerful teams. The set of teams has to be included with commas and no spaces. 
- **7. Bottom Teams / Equipos Cola** (optional) can be filled with the bottom teams of the competition. It has to be mentioned that both Top and Bottom Teams might be filled with any set of teams as well (all sizes). 
- **8. Intervals / Intervalos** will pack the performance of players/team in groups of N games, being N the number written in Intervals text box. For instance, if we split in groups of 5 the performance of a team that has played 13 games, statistics are separated for the 1-5, 5-10, and 10-13 games. 
- **9. Players / Jugadores** (optional) can be filled with a set of players that you want to scout by writting unique surnames. For example, both Josep Franch De Pablo and Felipe Dos Anjos De Paula play in Melilla; if we write *FRANCH* in the text box, only stats from Josep Franch will be extracted, whereas if we write *DE*, the performance of both players will be analyzed (De Pablo / De Paula). Again, more than one player can be added: (i.e) *FRANCH, AGADA*. 
- **Extract All Rounds / Extraer Todas las Jornadas** is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts the stats of the analyzed players for every single game in the given season.
- **Extract Team Stats / Extraer Estadísticas de Equipo** is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts statistics not only at a player-level but also at a team-level. 
- **Extract Rankings / Extraer Rankings** is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts sorted rankings of the given team for each particular stat. This checkbox is related with the Textbox of **Minimum Games / Minimo Partidos** (optional), which can be set in order to set a threshold to include (or not to include) players in the rankings according to the games they have played; if the box is empty, this threshold is automatically set to half the number of games. 
- **Configuration Folder / Carpeta Configuración** (optional) will be explained in Section 4 (Configuration Files).
- **Output Folder / Carpeta Destino** is the path where the output files will be stored. By default, it is a folder called ""Reports"" in the same ""BueStats"" main folder (you might create it for simplicity). 
- **Change Language / Cambiar Idioma** switches languages between Spanish and English; not only the interface will be affected, but also the output result. 
- **Load Configuration / Cargar Configuración** will be also explained in Section 4 (Configuration Files).

Finally...
**Extract Statistics / Extraer Estadísticas** is the main button to start gathering data from FEB. Once you press this button, you just have to be a little patient; Chromedriver will keep popping up and closing FEB sites automatically while extracting information. **Don't interact with these windows**, but you can keep using your computer as usual.  

### Scouting the whole league! 
A ""hidden"" feature of BueStats (useful for scouts) is that not only teams and players can be analyzed, but also the entire league! For doing so, you just have to change the text in team for *LIGA* (in the given example, Melilla should be substituted by LIGA). Again, the names of players can be filtered as well. Please note that it might take a while to generate the outputs since there's much more information. 

## 3. Output

BueStats produces quite a bunch of outputs in a .csv format, don't be overwhelmed because of that! The main reason for generating different statistic files is that the criteria to handle data changes among coaches and analysts, so there is not a best nor established way to do it! For a better visualization of the results, I would strongly suggest to mix the output files as you desire in a Google Spreadsheet file (by importing data), using different sheets and fixing the first row and the first two columns.  <br/>
<br/>
All those files starting with a letter *p* belong to *Player* stats, whilst files starting with letters *t* and *r* correspond to *Team* and *Ranking* files. 
  - The files that does NOT end with *Phases.csv* or *Rounds.csv* contain all player/team stats depending on several game-conditioning factors, such as Home / Away, Won / Lost, Initial-5 / Bench, Easy / Tough, Last3 games, and even the performance of the player against the desired teams included in Top/Bottom teams. 
  - The files that end with *Phases.csv* contain the player/team stats clustered into the N-game groups indicated in the above-mentioned intervals.
  - The files that end with *Rounds.csv* contain the performance of the player/team in each round of the season. 
  - Rankings (file that starts with *r*) includes the sorting of players from better to worst. <br/>

Apart from the game conditioning factors, the following advanced statistics are included: <br/> 
- **Player Level**: playerAST%. eFG%, TS%, GScored, Possessions, Floor Percentage, Points per Shot, %REB, %DRB, %ORB, STL%, Touches, Versatility, Usage, Win Scores, OER, DER, Net Points.  
- **Team Level**: Pace, OER, DER, eFG%, TS%,Play%, FTR%, %DRB, %ORB, %ASST, %TOV.  
  

## 4. Configuration Files
The amount of filters and text boxes of BueStats is not small, and since the whole purpose of building this program is to automatize processes, configuration files might be used in order to save time. This files are simple .txt files (such as the ones included, i.e. *ValoresDefectoORO.txt*), where you can set a default configuration and load it in the interface with a simple click; this feature might be useful for coaches that want to analyze their own team every single week. As it can observe, the text template follows this pattern:
```
team=UNICAJA
season=2018
division=EBA,DA
firstRound=1
lastRound=18
topTeams=MONTETUCCI,FRAMASA,JAEN
botTeams=NOVASCHOOL,MARBELLA,INTERIOR
intervals=7
players=
outputFolder=/mnt/DATA/FCBScrapping/Reports
```
By clicking the *Load Configuration* button (and making sure the *Configuration Folder* is properly set), the information in the text file is loaded. 

## 5. Plotting Interface
(NEW FEATURES! March 22nd)
As you might see, another GUI has been included in the source code (Graphics_GUI.py). 
Following the same nomenclature as the one seen in the previous Sections, simple 2D graphics with team logos can be extracted for any desired statistic (in both the X and Y axes), which can be classical ones / advanced / stats of the opponents. In order to do so, just create a folder called ""Images"" inside the existing ""Reports"" one (e.g. mkdir /mnt/DATA/FCBScrapping/Reports/Images) and copy and extract the images of ""Logos.zip"", which include (thanks to FEB and Muevetebasket) all 2019 logos splitted by divisions. 
Then, you just have to choose the desired rounds and statistics, and the plot will be automatically stored in your folder. Moreover, some npy files are also stored automatically to speed up the process. For instance, the first time you want to plot a specific graphic for (eg) 22 rounds, the scraper will browse around FEB website until getting all data; this process might take a while, but by storing these .npy arrays, it will be fully automatic the next time, without having to wait or whatsoever. Note that I included some default NPY files in a zip file (which are the ones corresponding to team data of some of the competitions before the covid-19 interruption - NpysGraphicAux.zip).

## 6. Data Ownership
All extracted BueStats' data belong to the Spanish Basketball Federation (FEB) and their corresponding boxscores, which are available online only for non-lucrative purposes. Please cite this GitHub or BueStats ifself if you are using this tool for writing scientific publications or sports articles (researchers and journalists). 

## 7. Contact
You can reach me by email (adria.arbues@upf.edu) or by Twitter (@arbues6), and any suggestion or doubt will be kindly addressed! However, I have a thesis to finish in less than 2 years, so I won't have the chance of adding brand new features quickly. <br/>

**Warning**: This is a very outdated project. I would recommend you look to build
your scrapers with something like [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org) instead.


About
-----

As a huge fan of both basketball and BeautifulSoup 4 (currently in alpha), I
decided to rewrite an earlier module I'd been using to scrape games from ESPN.
In order to use this package, you will need `lxml`, `mock`, and `bs4`
installed.

I've found it parses pages and data pretty fast &mdash; around a second to
parse a game, rearrange the data into a tuple, and then spit it back out. On
average, most games normally consist of 400 to 460 individual plays (timeouts
and interruptions are counted as an Offical Play).

The tuple returned consists of the away team, home team, and a list of
dictionaries (each one represents an individual play in the game). You can
always read the source code to find out more.

Also, the library does have numerous unit tests that you can check out.


Usage
-----

Using the datetime module.

    >>> import datetime
    >>> from espn import get_games
    >>> yesterday = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1)
    >>> for game in get_games(yesterday, iterable=True):
    ...     print game

Alternatively you can just use a string in `YYYYMMDD` format.

    >>> yesterday_string = ""20110330""
    >>> for game in get_games(yesterday_string, iterable=True):
    ...     print game

You don't have to use the `iterable=True` argument &mdash; a list will be passed
back to you.

    >>> april_fools_last_year = ""20100401""
    >>> games = get_games(april_fools_last_year)

You can also scrape NCAA Men's Basketball games by passing in a
`league='ncb'` argument.

    >>> march_1 = '20110301'
    >>> for ncb_game in get_games(march_1, league='ncb', iterable=True):
    ...     print ncb_game

The `daterange` function can also come in handy for generating days between two
specific dates.

    >>> import datetime
    >>> from espn import daterange, get_games
    >>> yesterday = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1)
    >>> week_ago = yesterday - datetime.timedelta(7)
    >>> for day in daterange(week_ago, yesterday):
    ...     for game in get_games(day):
    ...         print game

跟着singwa老师做的一个高性能篮球赛况直播室，主要包含实时直播模块和多人聊天模块，采用TP5整合原生swoole拓展编写。入门swoole最佳实战

高性能直播赛事平台-这是慕课swoole实战的项目,有些必要功能已完善,开发环境基于

Linux (Ubuntu 16.04LTS) 

PHP-7.2.5 

swoole-2.1.2

Redis-4.0.9

nginx-1.13.12

mysql-5.7.18

thinkphp-5.1

layer

本项目主要有两个版本，其中alpha测试版只包含基础功能，即只到第九章的内容，而beta测试版则有了alpha版没有的功能，包含：

1.请求访问写入日志功能

2.nginx转发功能

3.nginx多台服务器负载均衡配置

4.平滑重启脚本

5.多请求过滤

6.服务报警监控

其中的thinkphp是主要项目文件，其余的demo都是测试swoole代码用的。注释写的不少。认真的看应该都能看懂。

如何使用：
1.环境要求（基本）：项目只能运行在linux系统，并确保安装了PHP环境以及安装了swoole拓展，并且swoole开启了异步redis，还有普通的redis也要安装，因为项目中中也有同步redis，tp5的对swoole的适配已经在源码中做好，最好直接按我的开发环境来，其中你下载的在extend中如果没有ali这个文件夹，请将首页的ali放进去，不然使用不了短信服务。

2.如何调试：首先开启redis服务器端,再进入到thinkphp/script/bin/server/中,使用命令行执行：php ws_server.php,如果环境正确则不会报错。如果你使用的beta版的，因为添加了日志功能，所以每当有请求命令行会打印出日志信息，此时你应该执行一个脚本将日志输出到指定位置：
//这里可以使nohub来后台执行脚本，并且把输出的内容指定到一个文档中
 //nuhub /home/xiaolu/php/bin/php  /home/xiaolu/web/swoole_imooc/thinkphp/script/monitor/server.php >/home/xiaolu/web/swoole_imooc/thinkphp/script/monitor/log.text &
 websocket的默认端口为8811，监听的IP地址为127.0.0.1，在浏览器中使用地址：http://127.0.0.1:8811/live/login.html 进入了登录界面后 ，通过阿里的手机验证码可以正常的进行登录，这里是使用redis作为登录凭证的，redis存储的格式为sms_电话号码，因为我在源码中把阿里的短信验证凭证改了（文件在app\common\lib\ali\Sms类中），你需要正确配置你自己的凭证，或者直接在redis中执行 set sms_你的电话 123456,这样的话你就可以直接用123456作为你的验证码直接登录了.同样可以用这种方式这样多用户登录，多个用户登录后，可以直接测试聊天室功能，这个功能是属于不写入数据库的，因为实在没必要写这些重复性增删改查操作，你在聊天室输入内容后直接回车，其他用户便会实时收到你的信息，这时注意如果强刷页面就会消失了，实际上的聊天室是会记录到mysql数据库中的，但是这里我只是把收到的信息使用js让其显示到页面上而已。后台主持人功能使用浏览器访问：http://127.0.0.1/live/admin/live.html 界面比较粗糙，毕竟是测试版的。这里的话是默认指定了两支球队，实际上应该是从数据库进行动态显示的，写入内容选择发布即可，这时所有连接的客户端都会收到你发出的内容。核心代码都已经写好，数据库建表的文件也在那里，实际上需要完善的话只要建好数据库，把球队信息啥的录入进去，在完善一下页面，通信的模块基本不用改，需要改的都是普通的操作，懂tp5的很简单就能完成了。

这里我将安装环境所需的各类源码包也上传了。需要的话可以用。

我知道你们还是想看效果图的，那我还是放一下吧：

建议环境自己搭建，不要说学swoole的PHPer连基本环境都不会搭，遇到坑就多查资料，没有过不去的坑。实在不行，没办法了，那就用我的导出虚拟机系统包把，用vmware导入即可，源码和环境都有了。最后祝大家swoole学习愉快。虚拟机导出系统分享：链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/140PLiqkDaiPHaUHPBOit8Q 密码：95ko

# eurolig

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

The eurolig package provides a set of tools to obtain and analyze basketball generated data from the Euroleague.

## Overview

* API wrapper around the official website of the [Euroleague](https://www.euroleague.net/).

* Functions to obtain stats, play-by-play data and shot location data in a tidy format within R.

* Tools to analyze and visualize the data.


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages(""devtools"")
devtools::install_github(""solmos/eurolig"")
```


## Example

Let's say we want to analyze play-by-play data from the Championship game of the 2017-2018 season between Real Madrid and Fenerbache Dogus Istanbul. We can obtain the data by entering the game code and the season to the function `extractPbp()`. The game code for the game can be found in the game's [URL](https://www.euroleague.net/main/results/showgame?gamecode=260&seasoncode=E2017).

```{r}
library(eurolig)
pbp <- extractPbp(game_code = 260, season = 2017)
pbp
```

From these data we can extract information about the assists in that game from, say, Real Madrid (MAD):
```{r}
assists <- getAssists(pbp, team = ""MAD"")
assists
```

Shot location data can also be retrieved and visualized:
```{r}
shots <- extractShots(260, 2017)
plotShotchart(shots)
```

71,zhaoyu611/basketball_trajectory_prediction,Python,"# basketball_trajectory_prediction
This repo is an open source of paper : Applying bidirectional LSTM and Mixture Density Network for Basketball Trajectory Prediction.
I strongly recommend you to review Rajiv and Rob's repo at first.  the URL is https://github.com/RobRomijnders/RNN_basketball. 
I think they made cool job and details about basketball prediction. Also you can find their paper and referrences in the repo.
Based on their contribution, I set up a new repo, which proposed Bidirectional LSTM and Mixture Density Network (BLSTM-MDN) for the same prediction problem.
I did 2 jobs in the main, Hit or miss classification and trajecotry generating.
In the first job, users can choose one of models, including CNN, LSTM, BLSTM, LSTM-MDN and BLSTM-MDN. And trajectory genarating only works for LSTM-MDN and BLSTM-MDN.

# Setup
* TesnsorFlow 1.0 <br>
* sklearn <br>
* hyperopt <br>

# The files
* data: the original data is in 'seq_all.csv.tar.gz', and the 'seq_all.csv' is the unziped dataset.
* plot_staff: the scripts and final figures based on the models
* dataloader.py: data pre-process
* model.py: build model by TensorFlow
* util_MDN: utility functions for building model
* sample.py: functions used for generating trajectory
* main.py: main steps for classification and generating

# Run
Simply run file ""main.py"" in terminal with default argpases: python main.py
Here is the explanation of each argpase.
~~~python

  paser.add_argument(""--hidden_layers"", type=int,
                     default=2, help=""number of hidden layer "")
  paser.add_argument(""--seq_len"", type=int, default=12,
                     help=""sequence length"")
  paser.add_argument(""--dist"", type=float, default=5.0,
                     help=""distance from point to center"")
  paser.add_argument(""--hidden_size"", type=int, default=64,
                     help=""units num in each hidden layer"")
  paser.add_argument(""--drop_out"", type=float, default=0.7,
                     help=""drop out probability"")
  paser.add_argument('--learning_rate', type=float, default=0.005,
                     help=""learning_rate"")
  paser.add_argument('--epoch', type=int, default=1,
                     help=""epoch"")
  paser.add_argument('--batch_size', type=int, default=64,
                     help=""batch size"")
  paser.add_argument('--model_type', type=str, default='BLSTM_MDN_model',
                     help='the model type should be LSTM_model, \
                       bidir_LSTM_model, CNN_model, Conv_LSTM_model, \
                       LSTM_MDN_model or BLSTM_MDN_model.')
~~~
                       
If you want to generate some trajetories, please set ""generate_trajectory"" as True in code. Because it is False in default.
It should be noted that it only generates traejctory with BLSTM-MDN or LSTM-MDN.

Working through Basketball Data Science using py_ball and Python

## Agenda

My goal is to work through the book [Basketball Data Science with Applications in R](https://www.amazon.com/Basketball-Data-Science-Applications-Chapman/dp/1138600814) (BDS) by Zuccolotto and Manisera. The twist is that this repository will leverage [py_ball](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/py_ball) to source all of the data and the analysis will be done in Python. The hope is that this effort will expose a wider audience to the work presented in BDS and the available data. This repository will work through the following chapters:

* [Chapter 2: Data and Basic Statistical Analyses](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/tree/master/Chapter%202)
  - [Pace and Ratings](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Pace%20and%20Ratings.ipynb)
  - [Inequality Analysis](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Inequality%20Analysis.ipynb)
  - [Shot Charts](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%202/Shot%20Charts.ipynb)
* [Chapter 3: Discovering Patterns in Data](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%203)
  - [Assist Networks](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%203/Assist%20Networks.ipynb)
  - [Shot Density](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%203/Shot%20Density.ipynb)
* [Chapter 4: Finding Groups in Data](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%204)
  - [Shot Clustering](https://github.com/basketballrelativity/basketball_data_science/blob/master/Chapter%204/Shot%20Clustering.ipynb)
* Chapter 5: Modeling Relationships in Data

Each chapter is decently long, so there may be multiple Jupyter notebooks per chapter, depending on how things shake out.

Feel free to reach out with any questions by opening an issue here or [tweeting me](https://twitter.com/py_ball_).

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

The bbr package is designed to quickly fetch tidy data from www.basketball-reference.com. 
This package is actively under development and the interface will change as new features are added.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(""mbjoseph/bbr"")
```

## Example usage

The `get_season` function retrieves season summary data for one season. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(bbr)

ninetyone <- get_season(1991)
str(ninetyone)
```

The `get_players` function gets player data for individuals by last initial.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
a_data <- get_players(""A"")
str(a_data)
```

The `get_player_data` function returns data for each season that a player 
played. As an argument, this function takes a slug for the player you're 
interested in. This can be found using the `get_players()` function, and is 
part of the URL to the data of a player, e.g., if the URL is 
https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/abdelal01.html then the slug is 
abdelal01.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
abdelnaby_d <- get_player_data('abdelal01')
str(abdelnaby_d)
```"
76,owenauch/NBA-Fantasy-Optimizer,Python,"# The Porzingis Project

A script that scrapes stats for each player in the NBA from Basketball Reference, TeamRankings, and Rotowire, and generates an expected points value for each player. These expected points are then fed to a greedy algorithm that maximizes the total expected fantasy points while staying under a salary cap using a heuristic of preferencing undervalued players.

## How to Run

Clone the repo and run 
```
python NBAFantasyStats.py
```

##### Requires:
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download)

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - SQL database for scalability, modularity, and geoquerying support

# Setup

## Docker

0. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1.  Make `docker_entrypoint.sh` executable
    ```bash
    # Linux
    chmod +x docker_entrypoint.sh
    ```

2.  Start and build the 2 containers

    -   `--build` builds the images defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
    -   `-d` dettaches the terminal from the building process.
    -   Finally the script from (`docker_entrypoint.sh`) is executed.

    ```bash
    # In the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    - If there are errors you can see the logs
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```

3. Load Initial Database Models

    - It's also necessary to load in the fixtures when setting up the database:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata bounce_data.json
    ```

4. Go to http://localhost:8000

    - You should see the frontend of the project

    <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/JDQp06y.png"" width=""800"">

5. Enter a shell within the Docker container

    - To enter an interactive shell (in this case for the ""web"" service), you can use
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web bash
    ```

6. Create a superuser (Optional)

    - You may enter an interactive shell within the Docker container
     (in this case the container corresponding to the ""web"" service)
    - In the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` run
    ```bash
    # This open a bash shell inside the container
    docker-compose exec web bash
    ```

    - Then run `python manage.py createsuperuser`
    
    - Run `exit` to exit the container. It will keep running.

7. To stop the containers run `docker-compose stop`

    - :warning: Be careful with [`docker-compose down`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/down/) which stops the container but also **removes** them.
=======


## Troubleshooting

Ensure that your .env file is present and the required variables are set. 
Sometimes starting fresh can help, since things like volumes will persist
even after a container is removed, which can cause issues. You can remove all 
docker containers and volumes using the command:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q) && docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
and then trying the above steps again.

A [web application](https://shot-plotter.netlify.app/) for plotting events on a sport's playing area with a single click, while keeping track of any other details. The application supports download and upload of .csv files to retrieve that plotted data.

Currently 13 different playing areas across 9 different sports are supported: ice hockey (NHL, IIHF), floorball (IFF), handball (IHF), volleyball (NCAA), basketball (NBA, NCAA, WNBA), men's lacrosse (NCAA), women's lacrosse (NCAA), American football (NFL, NCAA), and soccer (NCAA).

![A screenshot of the main page of the web application allowing you to pick between sports.](./resources/sport-select-screenshot.png)

The web application is primarily built using D3.js.

### How to Use and Additional Information

From the main page, click on the sport/playing area you want. Each option has information about the specifications that describe that particular playing area, and its dimensions, which correspond to the coordinates.

#### Event Details

By default, four pieces of information can be specified for each event.

The period of the event can be logged through radio buttons.

The team can be specified through radio buttons and a text field that allows custom team names to be entered. The first team, which defaults to Home, corresponds to teal dots, and the second team, which defaults to Away, corresponds to orange dots. The legend below the rink clarifies which color corresponds to which team.

The player can be specified through a text field. If the player entry is 2 characters or less (for a player number, say), the player will appear on the event dot on the playing area.

The type of event can be specified, under Type or Outcome.Additional options can be specified by typing in the dropdown and selecting the new option that appears by clicking or pressing Enter. Each option corresponds to a different dot shape, as indicated by the legend below the rink.

Details logged for each event can be customized by clicking on the _Customize Details_ button at the bottom of the details panel. Details can only be customized when there are noevents recorded.

##### Customizing Setup

Clicking the _Customize Setup_ button will bring up a modal with a list of the current details. Drag-and-drop detail names to reorder them. Click on the eye icon to toggle whether it is visible. Click on the trash can icon to delete details. For created details, click on the pencil-in-a-square icon to edit those details. Reordering details changes their position in both the details panel and the table. The _X_ and _Y_ details cannot be hidden or deleted.

Special details can be added, which are details that do not take inputs but are specially calculated. Currently there a 3 types of special details:

-   **2-Location Events:** Using the _Enable 2-Location Events_ toggle, the ability to have 2-location events can be enabled. When enabled, _X2_ and _Y2_ details are added to the list of details. Like the _X_ and _Y_ details, the _X2_ and _Y2_ details cannot be hidden or deleted. When 2-location events are enabled, 2-location events can be plotted by either holding down the SHIFT button and clicking on two points in the playing area or by switching between 1-location and 2-location mode using the toggle above the playing area. This option is incompatible with Heat Map View.
-   **Distance:** For 1-location events, this detail will be the distance between the event and the closest net/hoop/end zone line center/etc. For 2-location events, this detail will be the be the distance between the two indicated locations.
-   **Shot Value (basketball only):** This detail is the number of points (2 or 3) a shot from the indicated location would be worth. For 2-location events, it will be the number of points for the second location.

There are several appearance options, which modify the appearance of the application but do not impact the data tracked. There are currently 3 appearance options:

-   **Widgets per Panel Row:** The number of widgets can be changed from its default value of 2 to 1 or 3 by choosing a new value in the dropdown labelled _Widgets per Panel Row_.
-   **Rows per Table Page:** The default number of events per table page can be modified by changing the number in the field labelled _Rows Per Table Page_. The default number is 10; the number must be an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive).
-   **Heat Map View:** By toggling on the option labelled _Heat Map View_, the option for heat maps (2D density plots) view is enabled. This adds a toggle above the playing area that allows switching between the traditional view with event dots and view that shows the location density of events per team (if Team is a current detail). Two checkboxes below the toggle allow hiding and showing the heat map for each team. This option is incompatible with 2-Location Events.

Default details can be restored by clicking on the _Reset to Defaults_ button.

Details configurations can be saved or restored through download/upload. When a detail configuration is downloaded, it stores the current order and visibility of details, as well as any newly created details. Also, currently selected/entered options in the details panel are made the default options when the configuration is uploaded; if a detail is not visible, it preserves its original default value.

Clicking on the _Add Details_ Button allows creation of new details. There are four options for types of new details: radio buttons, text field, dropdown, and time widget. The name of all details must be 1-16 characters.

Radio buttons are limited to at most 5 options; each option must be between 1-32 characters and all options must be unique. The default value can be selected by checking the appropriate radio button.

For a text field, a default value can be entered and can be up to 32 characters.

For a dropdown, options are entered in a text area, with each option on a new line. Each option must be between 1-50 characters. The first option is the default selection. Unlike with the _Type_ detail, new options cannot be added from the details panel, though options can still be searched.

A time widget is a timer you can choose to have count up or countdown. The starting time can be inputted when creating the detail; times must be in the format MM:SS or M:SS, where (M)M is minutes and SS is seconds. When using the time widget in the details panel, the time can be edited any time the time widget is paused. The timer can be paused/started by clicking on the button next to the time.

#### Playing Area

To plot events, simply click on the playin area where the event happened. When clicked, a dot will be added of the appropriate color based on team, shape based on type, and text based on player, and a row will be made in the table.

The playing area matches the specifications from the governing body as specified on the main page. For all playing areas, the center of the playing area has coordinates (0,0), the positive x-axis is to the right, and the positive y-axis is upward.

Massive credit to the [sportyR package](https://github.com/rossdrucker/sportyR) created by [Ross Drucker](https://twitter.com/rossdrucker9), using which the American Football fields (NFL and NCAA) were constructed.

The playing area size is not pinned to the window size. This allows you to zoom in and place the event exactly where you want it, but does mean the layout can become strange if you change your window size. Refreshing will readjust the size to match the current window size.

#### Table

The table logs the information for each event, as well as the row number of the event in the table. Events can be highlighted by clicking on the check box for the appropriate row. This will highlight the row in the matching team color, and both enlarge the dot on the rink and move it to the front if it was previously covered by other dots. Multiple events can be highlighted at once. Events can be deleted by clicking on the trash can in the appropriate row. All events can be deleted by clicking on the trash can in the header of the table; a prompt will confirm this choice.

The table, by default, shows the last page, which has the last 10 events recorded. Pages can be navigated using the _Prev_(ious) and _Next_ buttons at the lower-right of the table. The currently shown events and the total number of events recorded can be seen in the bottom-left of the table.

By click on the funnel icon in the header of the table, the filters become visible beneath the table headers and apply to the column in question. Multiple filters can be active at once; if there are multiple filters, only events that fit the criteria of all filters are visible. Events are filtered from both the table and playing area - in other words, events that do not fit the filter criteria are not visible as a row in the table or as a dot in the playing area. The form of the filter varies by the detail type:

-   **Numeric/Time (e.g. X, Y, #):** Numeric or time details will have a filter that takes a _minimum_ and a _maximum_ value and filters out any events with values for that detail not in the range specified. The range is inclusive of the minimum and maximum. If no value is specified for either the minimum or maximum, it is treated as if there is no limit in that direction. For example, if the minimum is indicated to be 4 and there is no maximum value indicated, only rows with a value of 4 or greater will be visible.
-   **Radio Buttons/Dropdown (e.g. Period, Team, Type):** Radio button and dropdown details will have a filter that takes the form of a dropdown and filters out any events with values not selected in the dropdown. If the dropdown has no selected options, it is as if the filter does not exist. It is possible to select multiple options in the dropdown filter; in this case, events with values corresponding to any currently selected in the dropdown will be visible. For example, if a dropdown filter currently has the values _Shot_ and _Goal_ selected, events with the value _Shot_ OR the value _Goal_ for that detail will be visible.
-   **Text (e.g. Player):** Text details will have a filter that is just a text box: any string that contains the string in the text box filter will satisfy the filter. If the string is surrounded in quote marks, double or single, instead only exact matches for the string satisfy the filter. For example, for the filter value _hat_, both _hate_ and _chat_ will be visible, but for the filter value _'hat'_ only the value 'hat' will suffice. It is also possible to use regular expressions in the text box filter for more complex text queries.

Clicking on the funnel icon will toggle whether the filters are visible. Filters are applied regardless of whether the filters are visible or not; hiding them does not remove all filters. When at least one filter is active and the filters are visible, a small X-in-a-square icon will appear near the funnel icon; clicking this X icon will clear all filters.

The number of currently filtered rows is also visible in the bottom left of the table.

#### Download/Upload Table

The event table information can be downloaded by pressing the _Download_ button. There is a text-field to customize the name of the file; otherwise, it defaults to the day and time when the web app was opened. Files are in .csv format, using comma separators, with the header row as it appears on the table, excluding _\#_, included in the file. When filters are active, only currently visible events that satisfy the filters are included in the file; this is indicated by the text of the button saying _Download Filter_ rather than just _Download_.

To initialize the table, a .csv file can be uploaded using the _Choose File_ button next to the Upload label. Only .csv files are permitted. The header row must exactly match the header row of the table, excluding _\#_, including order. Any custom shot types will be added in shot order. Custom teams will be added in order as they appear, alternating between the teal and orange team. This means if a shot by the orange team is logged first, when the file is downloaded and later uploaded, the team will be blue, but besides color there is no impact to the web app. _When a file is uploaded, any shots previously in the table are erased._

### Running Locally

To run the application locally, any method of running an HTTP server is needed to prevent browser issues with CORS (cross-origin requests - essentially not allowing the JS files to be loaded using the file:// protocol). Some methods include [http-server in Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), [http.server in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), or even some browser-based options like the [Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en), but any option will do.

Then, clone this repository; for most methods, it is sufficient to navigate into the repository folder and run the server, but check the exact way of starting a server for the chosen method. No additional packages need to be installed; additional packages are automatically acquired using CDNs.

81,llimllib/ncaa-bracket-randomizer,Jupyter Notebook,"# NCAA Bracket Randomizer

Generates a reasonable bracket for you, based on <a href=""http://kenpom.com/"">Ken Pomeroy's</a>
college basketball ratings.

This code was a hack when I first wrote it 14 years ago, another hack when I
re-wrote it 8 years ago, and even worse today. I use it once a year though, and
it works just fine even though it's still using jQuery and an ancient d3.

For each matchup, it compares the two teams in the game, calculates the odds of the favorite
winning the game, and chooses the winner. There are three settings that determine how it
does so:

#### No randomness

Always picks the favorite

#### Some

Picks the underdog if they win twice in a row.

If team A has a 75% chance of beating team B, the program will generate two random numbers
between 0 and 100; if both of them are greater than 75, team B will advance. Otherwise,
team A will advance.

#### Lots of randomness

Picks the underdog if they win once

If team A has a 75% chance of beating team B, the program will generate a random number
between 0 and 100; if it's greater than 75, team B will advance. Otherwise,
team A will advance.

## Calculating the Odds

[This ipython notebook](https://github.com/llimllib/ncaa-bracket-randomizer/blob/master/fitting_kenpom/fitting%20kenpom.ipynb) shows how I fit a very simple exponential curve to kenpom's predictions to reverse-engineer his win percentages. I then use the curve that fitted his predctions to decide how likely one team is to beat another, based on the difference between their kenpom ratings.

Created by [Brett Fazio](http://linkedin.com/in/brett-fazio/) and [William Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-chen-6474a216b/)

![](assets/bron.gif)

![](assets/davis.gif)

## Overview
Read our paper [here](https://github.com/brettfazio/CVBallTracking/blob/main/assets/Ball_Tracking.pdf).
## Requirements 

The libraries to run the code are [cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) (if trying to run/evaluate on the A2D dataset). 

An extended version of cv2, ```opencv-contrib-python```, is required. Make sure this is the only cv2 package installed. ```opencv-python``` is a different package that does not include support for the trackers. Do not install multiple different opencv packages in the same environment.
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

Additionally access to the YOLO tracker is required but this is already included in the `/src/yolo` folder. However, you must download the weights for the YOLO model. It can be done as follows:

```
cd src/yolo/weights/
bash download_weights.sh
```

If you wish to use the GOTURN tracker instead of the CSRT tracker (we recommend CSRT) you must download the GOTURN model [here](https://github.com/Mogball/goturn-files) and place it within the `src` folder.

To run on the A2D dataset, the Release of the dataset itself is also required. It is available [here](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/r/a2d/) and the unzipped folder entitled `Release` should be placed in the `/a2d` directory.

## Usage

The main entry point for this project is `main.py`. To avoid errors, please run it from the `src` directory. 

The most basic usage for the project would be to run on a single input video. It can be done as follows:

```
python3 main.py --video PATH
```

Where `PATH` is a path to a video file, for example:

```
python3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4
```

Adding the `--fast` flag only tracks the ball in frames after the first detection. 
```
python3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4 --fast
```

Adding the `--live` flag allows for real-time tracking. Live tracking is only available when used with the `--fast` flag.
Note: performance may be vary depending on CPU/GPU.
```
python3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4 --fast --live
```

To run A2D add the `--a2d` flag, and then to specify the number of samples use `--a2d_amt`. For example:

```
python3 main.py --a2d --a2d_amt 5
```

### Forward Pass Only

![Scoreboard landing page](bin/landing_page.png)

Scoreboard is a simple, secure and easy to use Scoreboard application built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

Scoreboard uses Socket.io's real time bidirectional event based communication system to integrate the scoreboard to the mobile-ready remote in real time.

## Usage

Clone the repository from GitHub by running the following in the terminal.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rukmal/Scoreboard.git
```

All of the Scoreboard configuration is stored in the ```config.json``` file. It must have the following data:

```JSON
{
	""_comment"": ""All times must be in milliseconds"",
	""tournament_logo"": """",
	""team_home"": """",
	""team_away"": """",
	""password"": """",
	""half_length"": 0,
	""timeout_length"": 0,
	""halftime_length"": """",
	""shot_clock_length"": 0
}
```

*Note: all fields filled with a '0' must be numbers. Also note that the configuration file is loaded when the application starts, so if any changes are made, the app must be restarted.*

Next, install all dependencies using npm (the Node.js package manager) and run the application.
```bash
$ cd Scoreboard
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

Navigate to ```localhost:3000``` in your browser and enjoy!

# Tagging Basketball Events with HMM

This case study shows how to implement Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in Stan using basketball player tracking data for the purpose of tagging events. The document `doc/hmm.html` discusses what a HMM is, how we fit HMMs in Stan, and how we apply this class of models to basketball data. We used a small sample of historical NBA player tracking data (see https://github.com/sealneaward/nba-movement-data for the raw data).

The workflow is separated into three parts (or model types):
1. Example HMM
2. Tagging a Drive Event
3. Defensive Assignment

93,arbues6/Euroleague-ML,Jupyter Notebook,"# Euroleague-ML
The aim of this repository is to publish several Python Notebooks to see how Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to basketball-based European Datasets. Although the given examples are quite simple (build-in scikit-learn functions), I expect these models to provide coaches/analysts/GM's with concrete baseline examples. 
In particular, at the moment (January 12th 2020), three tutorials about ML gold-standards have been included:
1. **Clustering**, where K-Means is used to group similar types of shooters based on shotchart-based features. 
2. **Classification**, where SVM is used to build a model able to classify player positions. 
3. **Regression**, where linear models are used in order to predict several statistics, as well as suggesting potentially interesting players for a given lineup. 

I really hope you find it useful. If you have any questions / suggestions, feel free to send me an email (adria.arbues@upf.edu) or a Twitter DM (@arbues6).
Big shoutout also to Nacho Gámez (@ngamezj), who provided me with a notable dataset to get started. 

## Required Dependencies
All code has been written in Python (3.7); the following libraries should be installed (all of the are included in pip3):
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install scikit-learn

96,gabarlacchi/MASK-CNN-for-actions-recognition-,Python,"# MASK R-CNN  sport actions fine tuning

Mask R-CNN is a powerful framework developed by facebook ([here more](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)), main features are:
- General and flexible for object instance segmentation 
- Part of Detectron, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm collection
- Powered in python and natively Coffe2 
- Also available a [Keras + TensorFlow version](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) (here you can find all the requirements)

## Aims of this repo

Address the network towards Sport activities detection using fine tuning technique.
We want that the new will be able to detect only main subjects labelled as activity name (i.e. only people)

![Aims](https://github.com/barloccia/MASK-CNN-for-actions-recognition-/blob/master/images/aims.png)

## Dataset

Dataset used is ucf24 (subset of ucf101): a set for Action Recognition that consists of 3194 videos from 4 kind of action. Resolution of each video is 320x240 px.
We intending to work frame-by-frame, and also need an annotated groundtruth:
A frame annotated version of this dataset it's available from this [repo by Gurkit](https://github.com/gurkirt/realtime-action-detection)
#### but:
Not whole dataset is annotated, only “frame of interest”: this produces the 70% of useless data.
Only bboxes groundtruth is available and no masks are annotated: so we produced a mask gt by ourselves.

![Data distribution](https://github.com/barloccia/MASK-CNN-for-actions-recognition-/blob/master/images/data.png)


## Getting Started
Here we propose a bief explenation of the files and their usages (we strongly refer to ucf24 dataset above mentioned!):
Coco weights used are available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)

- **actionCLSS_config.py**: extends and override net configuration.
- **actionCLSS_dataset.py** and **actionCLSS_dataset_partitioned.py**: offers two dataset classes: the first can be instantiated specifying the number of samples which compose it, the second read the samples from `testList.txt` and `validationList.txt`.
- **actionCLSS_training.py**: obviouslly, is the routine that manage the train.
- **evaluation.py** : evaluate the model on the whole testSet and iteratively save local results.
- **printPR.py**: use results produced by `evaluation.py` to compute Precision and Recall for each class.
- **createMasks.py**: produce person masks for each frame of the dataset, like exposed below.

![Mask Groundthrut generation](https://github.com/barloccia/MASK-CNN-for-actions-recognition-/blob/master/images/masks.png)

## Results

A brief argue can be over the divergence between a quantitative and a qualitative analysis on the maks and bb produced.
Below an example is showed: predictedion surclass the groundtruth, but numerically this means a penalization!

# About
Name `sport` is an abbreviation for Sequential Pairwise Online Rating Techniques. Package contains functions calculating ratings for two-player or multi-player matchups. Methods included in package are able to estimate ratings (players strengths) and their evolution in time, also able to predict output of challenge. 
Algorithms are based on Bayesian Approximation Method, and they don't involve any matrix inversions nor likelihood estimation. `sport` incorporates methods such glicko, glicko2, bayesian Bradley-Terry, dynamic logistic regression. Parameters are updated sequentially, and computation doesn't require any additional RAM to make estimation feasible. Additionally, base of the package is written in `C++` what makes `sport` computation even faster.

# Package Usage

## Installation
Install package from CRAN or development version from github.

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github(""gogonzo/sport"")
install.packages(""sport"",repos = ""https://cloud.r-project.org/"")
```

## Available Data
Package contains actual data from Speedway Grand-Prix. There are two data.frames: 

1. `gpheats` - results SGP heats. Column `rank` is a numeric version of column `position` - rider position in race.
2. `gpsquads` - summarized results of the events, with sum of point and final position.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sport) 
str(gpheats)
```

Data used in `sport` package must be in so called long format. Typically data.frame contains at least `id`, `name` and `rank`, with one row for one player within specific match. Package allows for any number of players within event and allows ties also. For all games, *output needs to be a rank/position in event*. Don't mix up rank output with typical 1-win, 0-lost. In `sport` package output for two player game is 1-winner 2-looser. Below example of two matches with 4 players each.

```{r echo=FALSE}
gpheats[1:8,c(""id"",""rider"",""rank"")]
```

## Estimate dynamic ratings

To compute ratings using each algorithms one has to specify formula. Form `rank | id ~ name` is required, which estimates `name` - rating of a player, by observing outputs - `rank`, nested within particular event - `id`. Variable names in formula are unrestricted, but model structure remains the same. All methods are named `method_run`.
`formula = rank|id ~ name` 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
glicko  <- glicko_run(formula = rank|id ~ player(rider), data = gpheats)
glicko2 <- glicko2_run(formula = rank|id ~ player(rider), data = gpheats)
bbt     <- bbt_run(formula = rank|id ~ player(rider), data = gpheats)
dbl     <- dbl_run(formula = rank|id ~ player(rider), data = gpheats)

print(dbl)
```

## Output

Objects returned by `method_run` are of class `rating` and have their own `print`
`summary` which provides most important informations. -`print.sport` shows 
condensed informations about model performance like accuracy and consistency of 
model predictions with observed probabilities. More profound summary are given 
by `summary` by showing ratings, ratings deviations and comparing model win 
probabilities with observed.

```{r message=FALSE}
summary(dbl)
```

To visualize top n ratings with their 95% confidence interval one can use 
dedicated `plot.rating` function. For DBL method top coefficients are presented 
not necessarily ratings. It's also possible to examine ratings evolution in time, 
by specifying `players` argument.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width = ""50%""}
plot(glicko, n = 15)
plot(glicko, 
     players = c(""Greg HANCOCK"",""Tomasz GOLLOB"",""Tony RICKARDSSON""))
```

Except dedicated `print`,`summary` and `plot` there is possibility to extract more detailed information to be analyzed. `rating` object contains following elements:

```{r message=FALSE}
names(glicko)
```

* `rating$final_r` and `rating$final_rd` contains ratings and ratings deviations estimations.
* `r` contains data.frame with sequential ratings estimations from first event to the last. Number of rows in `r` equals number of rows in input data.
* `pairs` pairwise combinations of players in analyzed events with prior probability and result of a challenge. 

```{r message=FALSE}
tail(glicko$r)
tail(glicko$pairs)
```"
99,kgilbert-cmu/basketball-gm,JavaScript,"# Basketball GM 4.0.0

A single-player basketball simulation game. Make trades, set rosters, draft
players, and try to build the next dynasty, all from within your web browser.
The game is implemented entirely in client-side JavaScript, backed by IndexedDB.

Copyright (C) Jeremy Scheff. All rights reserved.

* Email: commissioner@basketball-gm.com
* Website: <https://basketball-gm.com/>
* Development: <https://github.com/dumbmatter/basketball-gm>
* Discussion: <http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/>

**Basketball GM is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please
see LICENSE.md for details.**

## Development Info

If you just want to play the game, go to <http://basketball-gm.com/>.
Instructions below are for developers who want to run a copy locally so they can
make changes to the code.

If you want to contribute but get stuck somewhere, please contact me! I'm happy
to help.

### License and Contributor License Agreement

**Basketball GM is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please
see LICENSE.md for details.**

If you want to contribute code to Basketball GM, you must sign a contributor
license agreement. There are separate forms for individuals and entities (such
as corporations):

* [Individual CLA](CLA-individual.md) (this is probably what you want)
* [Entity CLA](CLA-entity.md)

Make a copy of the form, fill in your information at the bottom, and send an
email to commissioner@basketball-gm.com with the subject line, ""Contributor
License Agreement from YOUR_NAME_HERE (GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE)"".

### Step 1 - Installing

First, make sure you're using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or higher, older
versions probably won't work. Then, all of the tooling used in development can
be set up by simply installing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and running

    npm install

from within this folder.

### Step 2 - Building

Basketball GM uses Browserify for JS minification and clean-css for
CSS minification. To build the app along with all its assets, run

    npm run build

However during development, you probably would rather do

    npm run start-watch

which will start the server and watch JS and CSS files for changes and
recompile. This simply runs both `npm start` and `npm run watch` together, which
alternatively can be run separately if you wish.

Open `package.json` to see all available scripts.

### Step 3 - Running

To run the game locally, you need some way of running a web server to display
the content. There are currently two ways to do it. It doesn't matter which
you use as long as you can get it to run on your computer.

#### 1. Node.js (easiest)

Run

    npm start

and point your browser to <http://localhost:3000/>. If you use the command
`npm run start-watch` from above, then running the command `npm start` is not
necessary.

#### 2. Apache

The mod_rewrite rules in `.htaccess` can be used to make Apache run Basketball
GM. Everything should work if you point it at the `build` folder with
mod_rewrite enabled. That's how it's done on play.basketball-gm.com.

### Step 4 - Testing

ESLint, Flow, and, stylelint are used to enforce some coding standards. To run
them on the entire codebase, run

    npm run lint

Integration and unit tests are bunched together in the `js/test` folder.
Coverage is not great. They can be run from the command line in Karma with

    npm test

broken currently).

### Code Overview

Basketball GM is a single-page app that runs almost entirely client-side by
storing data in IndexedDB. The core of the game runs inside a Shared Worker (or
a Web Worker in crappy browsers that don't support Shared Workers), and then
each open tab runs only UI code that talks to the worker. The UI code is in the
`src/js/ui` folder and the core game code is in the `src/js/worker` folder. They
communicate through the `toUI` and `toWorker` functions.

The UI is built with React and Bootstrap.

In the worker, data is ultimately stored in IndexedDB, but for performance and
cross-browser compatibility reasons, a cache (implemented in
`src/js/worker/db/Cache.js`) sits on top of the database containing all commonly
accessed data. The idea is that IndexedDB should only be accessed for uncommon
situations, like viewing stats from past seasons. For simulating games and
viewing current data, only the cache should be necessary.

The cache is overly complicated because (1) the values it returns are mutable,
so you better not mess with them accidentally, and (2) when you do purposely
mutate a value (like updating a player's stats), you need to remember to always
write it back to the cache manually by calling `idb.cache.*.put`.

Also in the worker, there is a global variable `self.bbgm` which gives you
access to many of the internal functions of Basketball GM from within your
browser.

### Git Workflow

If you want to contribute changes back to the project, first create a fork on
GitHub. Then make your changes in a new branch. Confirm that the tests
(hopefully including new ones you wrote!) and ESLint all pass. Finally, send me
a pull request.

It's also probably a good idea to create an [issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/dumbmatter/basketball-gm/issues) before you start
working on something to keep me in the loop.

## Less Important Development Info

### Bootstrap

Basketball GM's layout is currently based on Bootstrap 3.1.1 with the following
options:

* @font-size-base set to 13px

### Basketball stuff

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, ""defensive rebounds"" is ""drb"".

### Cordova

The game runs equally well within a web browser and within Cordova (Android
4.4+). The codebase is designed to handle both situations (the main difference
is absolute vs relative paths, governed by window.inCordova in index.html).

Warning: This hasn't been tested in a while and is probably broken by now.

This resource is designed to allow for research into Natural Language Generation.  In particular, with neural data-to-text approaches although it is not limited to these.  This page will be updated with more detail, as soon as I have time and am able to post examples of other work I am doing with this.  For the moment, see our [IntelLanG2020](https://intellang.github.io/papers/) paper [SportSett:Basketball - A robust and maintainabledataset for Natural Language Generation](https://intellang.github.io/papers/5-IntelLanG_2020_paper_5.pdf).

# Denormalized Tables
To make things easier for people, I have uploaded on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CN74cxLrlBQpcStJIF1GQJO0TcTE6y2T/view?usp=sharing) a SQL script which will add some denormalized tables created from the core tables.  This provides things like:

* Per player/team on game/period statistics, with each player/time-period on one row.
* The same, except for some name information about each row.

On the statistics tables, each stat has a count, then also a ""_double"" column, which is one if it is ""double digits"", zero otherwise.  There are also columns at the end for whether the player had a ""double-double"" or ""triple-double"" etc.  These columns are included for teams, and per-period data as well, even though it does not always make sense to use it that way.

These have not been thoroughly tested yet, and I will at some point release the SQL scripts I used to make these tables.  I know the underlying table structure can seem daunting/obtuse.  It has been designed to allow for multiple sports and leagues whilst maintaining a high level of normalization.  It is like this, because I find it easier to work with, although I acknowledge that not everyone does.  For NLG research I am looking at simpler ways this data can be made available, and these 8 new tables are a first step in that direction.  You should be bale to just run the sql file with the psql command and write these tables atop your existing database.

## Quick Start
You will need a working [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installation, as well as a working Ruby environment if you want to use the ORM.  I suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io/), you will also need [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).  The ORM are written in [Ruby Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) rather than ActiveRecord.  Whilst this is all in a Rails app, there is no front-end implemented, it is just a convenient way for me to create scripts using rake tasks.  Note that this resource is not meant to be efficient.  If you require high data throughput for some reason, you can use the raw SQL.  The Ruby code is meant to provide a simple way to write scripts to export data, this might take an hour or two to run but it is simple to code and the training of models takes way longer than that anyway, so I find it to be acceptable.

You will need to set the password etc in config/database.yml
```
development:
	adapter: postgresql
	database: sport_sett_development
	user: postgres # Also accept 'username' as key, if both are present 'username' is used
	password: postgrespassword
	host: 127.0.0.1 # Optional
	port: 5432 # Optional

```
ATTENTION!
The original SQL file contained a but where the team_in_games.winner column was often wrong.  This was a convenience column, the scores appear to all be correct.  The file has now been updated, using the score fields to derive then correct the winner column.

Then navigate to root directory of repo, download database archive file, and ensure you have the correct ruby environment set (if using something like RVM).  Large files can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NUEHzNmwlG-TQB6dAxSiTUQQ7z6vbkNL/view?usp=sharing).
```
bundle install
tar -xvjpf db_after_statistics_2018.sql.tar.bz2
psql -U postgres -d sport_sett_development < db_after_statistics_2018.sql
```

You can now generate output files in the format required for the [system of Rebuffel et al.](https://github.com/KaijuML/data-to-text-hierarchical).  This takes about 1 hour to run.  The result of the below command has been uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11MG7uVDi5tB8By9WT_OqqqZ1NbiEaS3Y?usp=sharing) if you just want the OpenNMT training data without changing anything.

```
rake export:rebuffel
```
This will place several files in the **./exported_files** directory.  In order to create the partitions from these files as per our paper you need to combine the yearly files.  The yearly files contain data for just one season.
```
cd ./exported_files
cat D1_2014_data.txt D1_2015_data.txt D1_2016_data.txt > D1_training_data.txt
cat D1_2014_text.txt D1_2015_text.txt D1_2016_text.txt > D1_training_text.txt
cp D1_2017_data.txt D1_valid_data.txt
cp D1_2017_text.txt D1_valid_text.txt
cp D1_2018_data.txt D1_test_data.txt
cp D1_2018_text.txt D1_test_text.txt
```

or run

```
sh combine.sh
```

You can of course combine these in other ways.  This is just the partition scheme we used in our paper.

## Dimensions
Please see **app/models/rebuffel_open_nmt_record.rb** for code which creates this data.  If you wanted to change the data for each input sample, this is where you would do it, either by editing this file or creating your own similar class which is used in the rake script.

Notice how the class names follow the dimensions highlighted in our paper.  The UML diagram shows these relationships.

WARNING:  There are some issues with the play-by-play statistics.  Sometimes, they do not line up with what is reported in the box score.  I am working on scripts to automatically resolve these, although early investigation suggests there is only about 1 mistake every other game.  A mistake is commonly just one basket being attributed to the wrong player.  You can use the play-by-play, there is a lot of data there, but there are discrepancies.  Given this is such a large dataset, with original data entry likely by humans, it will not be 100% perfect.  My current plan for this is to take the game data, game period data, and play-by-play, then resolve discrepancies automatically where 2/3 of the sources agree on a correct answer, and the error can be resolved a net-zero effect (same team totals, points etc).

## Playoff / Preseason Games
Whilst some of these games are in the original Rotowire dataset, they are not yet included here.  The database is designed in such a way that they can be added later.  There are several reasons for not including them yet.  Firstly, it takes time to import this stuff.  Secondly, just doing regular season games makes the machine learning problem simpler (and it is still very, very difficult).  Finally, preseason games are played in all kinds of places, even against teams from different leagues.

## A Note on Generated Files
Some functions in Ruby such as sort_by are not deterministic beyond their given arguments.  This means that items which are of equal value when sorted are not always presented in the same order (just together).  The code has also been changed slightly to make it simpler (it used to be several different functions doing similar things).  I only mention this here so you know that the dataset generated is not the exact one used in the paper.  This is no bad thing, running on the exact same dataset over and over again is a bad idea.

## This is a work in progress
This is code from an academic research project, trying to get us closer to a sensible data solution in this domain.  It is not finished, it is not a commercial product.  I am happy to answer questions if you are doing research, but please have reasonable expectations.

## UML DIagram
Some attributes are missing for this and it needs a general update and tidy, but it is mostly right.  You can find all attributes by looking at the SQL tables.  Rails Sequel naming conventions have been followed.

## Adaptive Reinforcement Learning of curious AI basketball agents

![](/robot.jpg?style=centerme)


A machine learning project of learning NBA shots success ratio based on  410,000 records of [NBA players shots stats](http://stats.nba.com).

The project implements various ML techniques in order to create a ""Curious"" AI agent, which learns success ratios and implements the knowledge in [**exploration-exploitaition**](http://www.indigosim.com/tutorials/exploration/t0s1.htm) game simulation enviroment.

## Part 1 - [Bayesian Inference and Information Gain](part1-bayes/cur_project_bayes.ipynb)
After an [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) stage and preprocessing of shots data into categorical features we implemented a [bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) algorithm and evaluated the feature selection with Expected [Information Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_gain_ratio) criteria.


## Part 2 - [Neural Network Learning and Optimization](Part2-NN/cur_neural.ipynb)

Manual Neural Network implementation with numpy and SGD method. This part required new preprocess methods (to continuous features) and network structure optimization by improving [prediction AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) to 70%.

### Extra:
  - [Genetic algorithm optimization](Part2-NN/Genetic.ipynb)
  
    Implementation of a genetic algorithm for network structure optimization.
    
  - [Random Forest, SVM and PCA methods](Part2-NN/Other_models.ipynb)
  
    Benchmarks methods for accuracy estimation and feature selection.

## Part 3 - [Curiosity Loop with Adaptive Reinforcement Learning](/Part3-RL/Artificial_Curiosity_Loop.ipynb)
Implementaion of a Curosity Loop, using [Actor-Critic Method](https://cs.wmich.edu/~trenary/files/cs5300/RLBook/node66.html) and Bayesian Inference.

102,JKH-HCA2/BasketballRecLeague,JavaScript,"# BasketballRecLeague

## About

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a combination of programming strategies we've learned over the duration of the bootcamp. The app will be basketball themed, and it will display a list of leagues, teams, and members registered with the site. Users will also be able to register, edit, and delete new teams or members.

## Tech

The webpage will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, the page will utilize a server file to dynamically pull data from a local JSON file.

## How To

To launch the server, navigate to the parent folder BasketballRecLeague in your file directory. Drag that folder into your command line and change to that directory. Once there, perform a 'node server.js' to initialize the webserver. Then, enter 'http://localhost:8081/' in your browser's address bar.

## Website

![](public/images/screenshot.png)"
103,devinmancuso/nba-start-active-players-bot,Python,"## nba-start-active-players-bot

**What**

Python Selenium script that logs into your Yahoo fantasy basketball account and starts active players for today and upcoming days. Accepts arguments username, password, the number of days you would like the bot to process into the future and whether you want to see what the browser is running (useful for debugging) or run in headless mode.

**Why**

1. Never leave a player on the bench because you forgot to set your lineup
2. Why not

**Dependencies**

* Python 2.7
* [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/)
* Selenium WebDriver
* [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
* PhantomJS

**How**

1. Download script
2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install selenium click 
brew install node
curl https://www.npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
npm install phantomjs
```

You'll have to grab ChromeDriver manually.

3. Run the program

To run the program

`python start-active-players.py`

You will be prompted to enter the number of days you want the script to process, your Yahoo credentials and whether you want the script to run in headless mode (you can't watch what it's doing in the browser). 

You can include these details as options to avoid having to fill them in each time. For example to start active players for the next week including today.

`python start-active-players.py --days=7 --username=YahooUsername@yahoo.com.au --password=Y0urYah00Passw0rd --headless=False`

use `--help` for help documentation.

**To-Do**

- [x] Try / Except for missing command line argv.
- [x] Add headless support for PhantomJS
- [ ] Try / Excepts for key UI elements to ensure Selenium can find them before we click them.
- [ ] Put more asserts in places to tighten it all up
- [x] Include confirmations for each date as they are processed

**Contribute**

If you think this is a cool idea, but kind of inefficient, please submit a PR and let's make this better.

107,alfremedpal/PandasBasketball,Python,"# PandasBasketball
PandasBasketball is a small module intended to scrape data from [basketball-reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and convert it to useful pandas data structures, such as data frames, for future analytical purposes. The use of jupyter notebooks is encouraged.

# Installation
```
pip install PandasBasketball
```

After installation you can then import it to your environment like this:
```
from PandasBasketball import pandasbasketball as pb
```

## Requirements
Please make sure you meet the following rquirements:
- Python 3.6+
- requests
- pandas
- Beautiful Soup 4

All the requirements can easily be met with the installation of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution.

# Usage
## :basketball: Players
Inside a player's page on the basketball-reference website you can find several tables, and most of these tables can be obtained as a pandas data frame by calling `get_player(player, stat)`. The 'player' refers to the name of the html file used by basketball-reference inside the url, and the 'stat' means the type of table.

The currently supported tables are:
- Per Game (`per_game`)
- Totals (`totals`)
- Per 36 Minutes (`per_minute`)
- Per 100 Poss (`per_poss`)
- Advanced (`advanced`)
- Playoffs Per Game (`playoffs_per_game`)
- Playoffs Totals (`playoffs_totals`)
- Playoffs Per 36 Minutes (`playoffs_per_minute`)
- Playoffs Per 100 Poss (`playoffs_per_poss`)
- Playoffs Advanced (`playoffs_advanced`)

The rest of the tables will come in the future.

### Example
To get the 'Per Game' table for LeBron James you would do something like this:
```
df = pb.get_player(""jamesle01"", ""per_game"")
```

### Optional Arguments
The `get_player()` method supports two optional arguments:
- `numeric` - returns the data frame with its columns alreay converted to numeric
- `s_index` - returns the data frame with its column 'Season' as the index

Both are set to `False` by deault.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame **does not** include the table's footer.
- The resulting data frame will have the same column names as the table's header but it will not have a set index. To set the 'Season' column as index set the argument `s_index` to `True`. 
- The columns will be of type 'object', so in order to perform arithmetic functions on them you will need to convert them to numeric. You can do something like this:
```
lbj_pg = pb.get_player(""jamesle01"", ""per_game"")
lbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns] = lbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors=""ignore"")
```
Or you cant set the optional argument `numeric` to `True`.

## :basketball: Player Game Logs
You can get all of a player's games in a season by calling `get_player_gamelog(player, season)`. The `season` argument must be the last year in which the season took place. 

### Example
To get all of Kawhi Leonard's games during the 2017-2018 season:
```
df = pb.get_player_gamelog(""leonaka01"", ""2018"")
```

### Optional Arguments
The function `get_player_gamelog` supports one optional argument:
- `playoffs` - returns **only** the playoffs games if set to `True`

Set to `False` by default.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame will use the 'Rk' column as its index
- The data frame does not include those rows which are just the header again
- If the player missed a game, the row will be filled with blanks ("""")

## :basketball: Last n days
Get a data frame with all the season's available players stats over the last n days by calling `get_n_days(days)`.

### Example
```
df = pb.get_n_days(10)
```
### Optional arguments
`get_n_days` supports one optional argument: 
- `player` - returns a pandas series with the stats of the specifed player

`player` is set to `all` by default.

### Considerations
- The resulting data frame will have the column 'Players' as its index by default
- The data frame is in descending order by GmSc

## :basketball: Teams
You can call a team's seasons table with `get_team(name)`. The argument `name` is the team's three-letter abbreviation (e.g. OKC, MAV).

### Example
To get OKC's table:
```
df = pb.get_team(""OKC"")
```

## :basketball: Generate player code
Baskteball-reference uses a special code to build each player's unique html page. As of now, *almost* all functions in `PandasBasketball` expect that code to get the stats for the specified athlete. If you don't want to copy and paste the code from the URL into the function you can try calling `pb.generate_code(player)`. 

**Note:** this is not fully tested, so it is possible to get an incorrect code.

### Example
To get the player code for LeBronJames:
```
pb.generate_code(""LeBron James"")
```
This will output `'jamesle01'` 

Using it with other functions:
```
df = pb.get_player(pb.generate_code(""Donovan Mitchell""), ""per_game"")
```


# Future
- ~~Make this project pip-installable~~
- Add support for the rest of tables on a player's page
- Implement function to obtain team stats per season
- ~~Implement function to get the last n days stats~~
- Implement function to obtain game results by date

#### Hoopr is a place where basketball enthusiasts can find parks and gyms to play the sport they love. Know before you go: Hoopr allows users to write reviews and check if a park or gym meets their needs.

*Only available in the NYC area.*
</hr>

#### Hoopr: https://hoopr.herokuapp.com/#/

</hr>

## Technologies:

* Ruby on Rails: used to set up Hoopr's backend structure.

* PostgreSQL: used to host our database.

* Javascript: primary language used for our front-end logic.

* jQuery/Ajax: used primarily to make requests to our database.

* React/Redux: used to create functional rendering / displays of our data to users. 

* CSS: used to style HTML elements.
</hr>


## User Authentication:

  * Implemented a multi-step login process that allows Hoopr users to create profiles securely without having to worry about their personal and sensitive information being leaked. We do this through the encryption of passwords and never storing any of their passwords directly into our database. 

## Reviews:
  * Modal that allows users that are logged in to create a review and rate a basketball court. The rating system temporarily sets the state as users choose their rating. The rating then persists and is automatically added to the profile of the basketball court.

##篮球战术画板

        体育学院的一个老师做一个创新教学的课题，找我们实验室的老师做一个篮球战术画板，由于我们实验室主要是做硬件嵌入式的，所以
        
    老师就让我和另一个同学用DE1-SOC-MTL2开发平台的FPGA做。我们用基于FPGA的Nios II软核搭一个CPU，然后用C语言写裸机程序。
    
    由没有操作系统、Nios II 软核实现的CPU的性能也非常差，而且用C语言写起来也非常复杂，所以我们只实现了非常简单的功能。过年
    
    来了后另一个同学复习考研了，所以我就打算用Android写一个App, 在这之前我写过一些非常简单的小程序，如wifi小车App和视频
    
    监控App等，而且自己也对Android开发比较感兴趣，平时有空时也看了一些Android知识，也想今后往这方面发展，自己也比较有热情，
    
    整个过程也还算比较顺利。
    
        里面的资源图片是找的别人的App里的解压出来的，整个框架只是用的AndroidStudio自带的Navigation Drawer Activity, 然后去
    
    掉了Toolbar等，自己重新添加了TitleBar，侧边栏也做了一些修改。
  
  
   
###功能：
- 1. 分段画战术轨迹，最后合成播放
- 2. 多次重复播放
- 3. 改变轨迹颜色和宽度
- 4. 战术保存
- 5. 战术库读取播放，删除战术

============

What is this?
-------------

Interactive and printable bracket for the annual NCAA March Madness basketball tournament. You can use this to publish the first round matchups, and it lets people pick their winners then print out their brackets. You can also use this to publish the current state of the tournament all the way down to the championship, ala [this 2015 NCAA Tournament men's results bracket](http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27715608/ncaa-mens-tournament-bracket-2015)

This is not responsive, but please feel free to fork this and make it so. We accept pull requests! Demo: http://www.bracketadvisor.com/interactive-bracket/

Assumptions
-----------

* Google docs
* jQuery
* Miso

What's in here?
---------------

The project contains the following folders and important files:

* ``index.html`` -- Blank bracket
* ``/js`` -- Javascript
* ``/css`` -- Strangely enough, stylesheets

How to use this
---------------

1. Make a copy of this Google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K4luNfy1yXkD4I-6CKEzvwPKCRAqCu9R6qo0ZMGQBn8/edit?usp=sharing
2. The teams for each region are in separate tabs including the play-in games.  All the labels are in the first tab. Once you have entered all the teams and information, ""Publish to the web...""
3. In the Publish window, you'll find a URL that will contain a key. Copy that and paste into line 16 of js/bracket.js
4. You'll probably want to update the year- and tournament-specific information at the top of index.html

mRchmadness is *not* designed to predict the winners of tournament games, but
it *is* designed to answer the question: *Given the true probabilities
dictating tournament results and given the probabilities with which my pool
opponents make their picks, what bracket maximizes my chances of winning my
pool?* To answer this question, we simulate tournament results and opponent
picks over and over again, testing a set of candidate brackets against pool
opponents in each simulation and choosing the bracket that performs best.

## Installation

``` r
# For the latest version of the package, updated frequently during the first
# couple weeks of March, install directly from this GitHub repository.
devtools::install_github('elishayer/mRchmadness')

# If you're not using this R package to fill out a bracket on a deadline, you
# might prefer to install the latest stable version from CRAN.
install.packages('mRchmadness')

We all know Excel sheets hold useful information, but it can be hard to read the data we want, and especially hard to compare two specific datasets within all that data. Bots, on the other hand, can do that hard work of finding the information for us. 

We will read some NBA statistics from Excel sheets in Python using the Openpyxl library. How will we know which statistics to look for and return? Incoming SMS is two players and a type of NBA statistic, and then the outgoing SMS looks up the statistics of the corresponding players.

<h3>Data</h3>
The data we use is about specific NBA players from <a href = ""stats.nba.com/players""target=""_blank"">this past season</a>.
There, you can specify which season, season type (playoffs versus regular season), data type (game average versus total for the season), which dates, and more. Fun, right? 

No Microsoft Excel? No problem! You can copy and paste the data directly into Google Sheets and export it as a .xlsx file. Here is an excerpt from the the Excel sheet (lots more data not shown to the right and below.) 

<img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27196938-6cbfa208-51da-11e7-9469-98d30a62ac92.png"">
Some statistics above include age, games played, wins, losses, minutes, points, field goal percentage, three-point shot percentage, and more.

<h3>Setup your Developer Environment</h3>
Make sure your Python and Flask development environment is set up, like <a href = ""https://www.twilio.com/docs/guides/how-to-set-up-your-python-and-flask-development-environment#create-a-simple-flask-application"">this</a>. If you don’t have a Twilio number to send and receive SMS messages, let’s do that <a href = ""https://www.twilio.com/console"">here</a>.


Once your environment is up and running, run the following command in the directory your python file will live in. 
<img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27196974-8e4d2148-51da-11e7-89a5-7cea43505961.png""/>


<h3>Building the Flask app</h3>
Make a file called app.py, and import these libraries at the top.
<img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197002-ae6e5dde-51da-11e7-8ba4-7961b2475760.png""/>

And then make our Flask object:
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197789-9ad16264-51dd-11e7-8fec-2bf0295342a1.png

Don't forget to run <a href = ""ngrok.com"" target=""_blank"">Ngrok</a> http 5000 in terminal! In your terminal in the same directory, run ngrok http 5000.
<img src =""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27196971-8a1114b8-51da-11e7-821a-b61939f8b597.png""/>

Now onto some fun stuff.

<h3>Parse the Data with Openpyxl</h3>
<a href = ""https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/"">Openpyxl</a> is an open source Python library that reads and writes Microsoft Excel 2010 files.
 
The higher-order function below takes in our entire Excel file of NBA data returns a dictionary of the data in our Excel file. Players are the keys, and the specific statistic data per each player as the values. 

<img src =""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197009-b18fce58-51da-11e7-8070-be60cabb2644.png"">

The data structures we use are two separate lists of players and their corresponding statistics we want to search (ie. just games played, wins, losses, minutes, points, field goal percentage, etc.) We then map those statistics to different columns of the Excel sheet, represented by letters, in stat_dict.
 
Then, we need to load the Excel file full of data with load_workbook and create a worksheet. More complex apps or data may have different sheets (with NBA data, one could be Regular Season while another could be for the Playoffs.) Since we only have one worksheet, we just want the one at index zero. Then, beginning with the for loop, we loop through each item in our Excel spreadsheet. 
 
Finally, we loop through our Excel spreadsheet. The “A” column is for players, so each player in the column (and thus the sheet) are added to our list. Then, we loop through the column which is the value of our dictionary of statistics and columns and add each to the separate statistics list.
 
Say you want to read from columns. Each column is represented by a letter (that’s why we made the dictionary above, but the dictionary values match the columns in the Excel sheets.) To search multiple columns and just the front row, you could search something like this:  
<img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197012-b43cf73e-51da-11e7-838c-77eb6d819cd1.png"">

With our data, this returns the name of the player in the first row (Russell Westbrook) and the statistics from columns D, E, and F (wins, losses, and minutes played.)
 
If you want to access an individual cell, the following code are two different ways to return whatever is in the B column in the second row. (Without using value, you would just get “<Cell u'Sheet1'.B2>”.)
<img src =""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197029-c494b70c-51da-11e7-8c9a-15696598675c.png"">

(another way of writing this same line of code is: <em>b2v2 = ws.cell(row=2, column=2)</em>)

What does our code do after searching through the cells and rows creating our two distinct lists? These two lists are then zipped together into one dictionary with players as keys and the corresponding statistic numbers as values. This dictionary will be returned in our SendSms() function so we can check if the inputSMS message is in the dictionary (and thus in the Excel sheet.)

Now, onto the core of the code! 

<img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197031-c7165166-51da-11e7-8bcd-30478e7fdaaa.png"">

Let’s break this down. First, we get our input SMS and convert it to lowercase so it’s easier to check. Then, we break it up by whitespace and add each piece to a string array. If that array has a length of five (which is what we expect, because input should be two players (first and last names) and a statistic), then we assign variables to the two players and the statistic.
 
Next, we call our higher-order function parseDataIntoDict, and use the dictionary it returns to check that the variables are in it. If they are, we check if the data of one player is greater than the other. Depending on that, a different message is returned. If one or both of the players are not in the dictionary, we return an error message. 
 
Lastly, we run our Flask app!

Wow! You just used Openpyxl to read an Excel spreadsheet. Isn’t it a very handy tool? Who knew reading and writing an Excel spreadsheet could be done this way?
 
So what’s next? Think of the possibilities! You can use Openpyxl for financial data, for baseball data, etc.

118,Tanapruk/fb_emoji_basketball,Python,"# Facebook emoji Basketball Script

Python shell script to automate playing Facebook basketball. It is a script that use uiautomator python
[![Facebook Basketball Shooter](https://github.com/Tanapruk/fb_emoji_basketball/blob/master/fb_demo.gif)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkmA7ZoSWr4)

####Requirement
* Android phone with root access
* PC (Mac or Linux are preferable)
* ADB
* Python
* [uiautomator](https://github.com/xiaocong/uiautomator)

####Instruction
* Plug your Android device to your PC and connect to ADB
* Launch the basketball game
* Run the script (Required python, uiautomate and adb)
* Enjoy

#### Level Support
* score 1-10 (100%)
* score 11-20 (100%)
* score 21-30 (98%)
* score 31-40 (90%)
* score 41-50 (70%)
* in progress..

#### Explanation
* score 1-10 The rim is stationary. We can simply use drag function from the ball to the rim.
* score 11-20 The rim is moving and has a constant speed. Releasing the ball and set shooting location as an offset of the releasing position by constant pixels.
* score 21-30 The moving rim speed is quicker than the score 11-20 and has an unstable speed. We cannot use the method in the previous level. By trial and error, I found that we should fix the shooting position to the middle of the screen. The decision making will be made in the releasing position. However, the optimal releasing position is so small, so the ball get shot not very often. I counter this problem by adding a delay when the rim moves to area before the optimal releasing position.
* score 31-40 The rim is moving around across two axis in a transparent container. By statistic, it move to the middle of the screen very often, so I fixed the shooting position to the frequent passing position. The logic is similar to the score 21-30.
* score 41-50 Similar to the score 31-40, but with bigger boundary. The logic is being developed. Initial guess is like the previous 3 sections.

### Support Devices
* I only test in my Nexus 4, but it should be fine on other devices.

A Go client to retrieve NBA statistics from stats.nba.com. The client also supports syncing data to a mysql database.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/jbowens/nbagame?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/jbowens/nbagame)

![Russ](https://github.com/jbowens/nbagame/blob/master/russ.jpg)

## nbaapi.com

If you're just looking for an API for the NBA, check out the [nbaapi.com repo](https://github.com/jbowens/nbaapi.com) that uses nbagame to sync its database.

## Overview

The endpoints exposed by nba.com are not intended for public consumption, and no public documentation exists. This package attempts to wrap these endpoints in a clean, well-documented interface.

```go
teams, err := nbagame.Client.Teams()
if err != nil {
  panic(err)
}

for _, team := range teams {
  fmt.Printf(""%s, %s - %v\n"", team.Name, team.City, team.Wins)
}
```

## Database Syncing

NBAGame is most useful as a means to populate a MySQL database with up-to-date NBA statistics. The [nbagame/db/sync](https://godoc.org/github.com/jbowens/nbagame/db/sync) package provides a programmatic interface for syncing data. If you don't need the programmatic interface or will be using a language other than go, you can use the command-line tool in the [nbagame/cmd](https://github.com/jbowens/nbagame/tree/master/cmd) package. First, follow the directions in the [nbagame/db README](https://github.com/jbowens/nbagame/tree/master/db) to setup your MySQL database and your goose dbconf.yml configuration file. If you have permissions to create new MySQL databases and access them without credentials, you can create the database by running

```
mysql -e ""CREATE DATABASE nbagame""
go get bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose/cmd/goose
goose up
```

Once your database is constructed, `go install ./cmd/...` to install the command-line utilities.

To sync data to the entire database, run the following command:

```bash
nbagamesync -season=""2015-16""
```

By default, the command-line tool only loads data from the current season (except for players, which will load all historical players too). If you want to load data from a particular season, add the season flag.

```bash
nbagamesync -season=""2015-16""
```

If you don't want to sync everything, specify which entities you want to sync as arguments, ex:

```
nbagamesync teams games
```

Once you've loaded the data, open a MySQL client and try querying. Here's a sample query that calculates average blocks per game by team.

```sql
SELECT teams.id, teams.name, AVG(stats.blocks) AS avg_blocks_per_game
FROM teams
LEFT JOIN team_game_stats ON teams.id = team_game_stats.team_id
LEFT JOIN stats ON team_game_stats.stats_id = stats.id
GROUP BY teams.id ORDER BY avg_blocks_per_game DESC;
```

## March Madness Optimization
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is the full code used for the [Shiny march madness app](https://bracketmath.shinyapps.io/ncaa/). You can run the code yourself to customize more things such as increasing the number of simulations, increasing the bracket pool size, changing the projection model, and more. To run, the order of files is: 1-simulate-tournament, 2-simulate-brackets, 3-calculate payouts, 4-optimize-brackets in that order. The data for the shiny app is in the Shiny folder but it is just less customizable. Below I explain the methodology. <br /> <br />

### 1. Projection and Simulation
The algorithm starts by projecting all the tournament matchups and then simulating the tournament:

```{r , echo=F, eval=T , include=F}
load(""Shiny/2018/team-data.RData"")
load(""Shiny/2018/BracketResults_FullTournament_1000sims.Rda"")
load(""Shiny/2018/TourneySims_1000sims.Rda"")

input<-list(r1=10, r2=20, r3=40, r4=80, r5=160, r6=320, upset1_mult=1, upset2_mult=1, upset3_mult=1,
            r1_seed_mult=0, r2_seed_mult=0, r3_seed_mult=0, r4_seed_mult=0, r5_seed_mult=0, r6_seed_mult=0,
            r1_seed_bonus=0, r2_seed_bonus=0, r3_seed_bonus=0, r4_seed_bonus=0, r5_seed_bonus=0, r6_seed_bonus=0,
            year=2018)

source(""functions.R"", encoding = ""UTF-8"")
source(""Shiny/optimize-brackets.R"")
source(""Shiny/calculate-bracket-payouts.R"")

# brackets<-calcBrackets(brackets[, 1:63], brackets, tourneySims) #calculate bracketpayouts/percentiles

##calculate data
sims<-max(tourneySims$Sim)-backtest
inspect<-as.data.frame.matrix(table(tourneySims$Team_Full[tourneySims$Sim<=sims], tourneySims$Round[tourneySims$Sim<=sims])/sims) 
probs<-inspect[order(inspect$R6,inspect$R5,inspect$R4,inspect$R3, inspect$R2,  decreasing = T), ]


numBrackets<-nrow(brackets)

r1<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R1"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r1)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R1"")
r2<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R2"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r2)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R2"")
r3<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R3"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r3)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R3"")
r4<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R4"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r4)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R4"")
r5<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R5"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r5)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R5"")
r6<-as.data.frame(table(as.vector(unlist(brackets[, grepl(""R6"", colnames(brackets))])))/numBrackets);colnames(r6)<-c(""Team_Full"", ""R6"")
ownership<-Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, all=TRUE), list(r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6))
ownership[is.na(ownership)]<-0

analyze<-TourneySeeds[TourneySeeds$Season==year, ]
analyze$Team_Full<-Teams$Team_Full[match(analyze$Team, Teams$TeamID)]
names<-unique(analyze[, c(""Team_Full"", ""Seed"")])
names$Seed<-as.numeric(substring(names$Seed, 2, 3))
pasteSeed<-function(teams){
  paste(names$Seed[match( teams, names$Team_Full)], teams, sep="" "")
}

ownership$Team_Full<-pasteSeed(ownership$Team_Full)
ownership<-ownership[order(ownership$R6, ownership$R5, ownership$R4, ownership$R3, ownership$R2, ownership$R1, decreasing = T), ]

row.names(probs)<-pasteSeed(row.names(probs))

```

```{r , echo=T, eval=T , include=T}
head(probs, 20)

```

Above are the probabilities of teams reaching each round for 2018, 1000 simulations <br /> <br />


### 2. Bracket-Pool Simulation
Then, using [ESPN Pick Percentages](http://games.espn.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/2018/en/whopickedwhom), you can simulate a pool of brackets.



```{r , echo=T, eval=T , include=T}
head(ownership, 20)

```

Above are the ownership percentages by round for the pool of brackets, 1000 brackets. You can start to see that certain teams are overvalued in the pool of brackets compared to their projections, while others seem to be undervalued in the pool relative to their projection.


### 3. Optimization
Finally, you can apply your scoring to get finishes for each bracket in the pool compared to eachother across the simulations. You can set up an optimization to return the optimal bracket(s) for any number of specifications, Ex: Return 1 Bracket to maximize P(90th percentile). 3 brackets to maximize P(97th), 1 bracket to maximize points, etc. I can also test out other brackets against the pool of 1000 brackets in order to get alternative brackets which may do well but weren't included in the pool.

```{r , echo=F, eval=T , include=F}
#load improved pool--
load(""Shiny/2018/Improved-Brackets.Rda"")
brackets<-customBracket2

```

Below is the bracket which maximized P(90th percentile) for 2018:


```{r , echo=T, eval=T , include=T,fig.width=11, fig.height=9 }
brackets$Prob90<-apply(brackets[, grepl(""Percentile"", colnames(brackets)) & !grepl(""Actual"", colnames(brackets))], 1, function(x) sum(x>=.90)/sims)
max(brackets$Prob90) #projected P(90th percentile)
plotBracket(brackets[which.max(brackets$Prob90), 1:63], text.size = .8)

```


```{r , echo=T, eval=T , include=T}
brackets[which.max(brackets$Prob90), c(""Percentile.Actual"", ""Score.Actual"")]

```

Using this system allows you optimize the brackets you enter for march madness. In addition, it allows you to change the scoring system, pool sizes, number of brackets entered, and projection system. By testing out the projected finish based on different strategies like point maximization, or point maximization in R1-2 only, or other ideas, you can get an idea of how you should balance expected point maximization with being contrarian.

> 🏀 The NBA LINE Bot with 9 features!

Watch NBA games, check the schedule, lookup the stats, search for players by using Daily-NBA. [Button carousel templates](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#buttons) are designed and implemented in every feature. Instead of directly typing the commands to the LINE bot, users can just simply **press buttons** on the carousel template to browse the features and access the NBA information!

There are four main componenets in this project

- **LINE Bot:** Built by the official [LINE Messaging API](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/overview/)
- **Web Scraping:** Use [BeutifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape several websites to retrieve NBA information
- **Backend:** Built the backend with [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) to handle the webhook
- **FSM:** Create FSMs with [pytransitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) for the users state management

## FSM

<p align=center>
    <img src=""img/fsm.png"">
</p>

[**Finite State Machine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) is implemented for the state management of the users. A FSM is maintained for each individual user. This way, every user has their own independent state, and the operations between two different users will not affect each other.

Finite state machine is a model in [Theory of Computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation). This model is implemented in Daily-NBA. Each feature is represented by a **state**, and the button that user pressed on the carousel template will trigger the **transitions** between states. The FSM graph is drawn by **GraphMachine** in [transitions.extensions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions).

128,bziarkowski/euRobasket,R,"# euRobasket

euRobasket is an R package which helps download, prepare and analyze data from
European basketball leagues. In current version data sources include: realgm.com,
fibalivestats.com, live.fibaeurope.com.


# Installation

```R
devtools::install_github('bziarkowski/euRobasket')
library(euRobasket)
```

# Play by play functions
With euRobasket you can download play by play data from fibalivestats.com and live.fibaeurope.com and prepare it for further analysis.

This package makes play by play data easier to analyze by converting it to stints (stint is a period of time that the same set of ten players are on the court). But you can also download raw play by play.

```R
#download raw play by play
get_raw_pbp_fibalivestats(742430)
get_raw_pbp_livefibaeurope(108510)

#get stints from play by play
get_stints_fibalivestats(742430)
get_stints_livefibaeurope(108510)
```

With stints you can calculate lineup stats and on/off splits.
```R
#calculate lineups stats from single game with lineup_stats()
get_stints_fibalivestats(742430) %>% 
lineups_stats()

#calculate on/off splits for Ł. Koszarek and J. Florence from single game with on_off_splits()
get_stints_fibalivestats(742430) %>% 
on_off_splits(players = c('Ł. Koszarek', 'J. Florence'))

```

# Getting the ids for fibalivestats.com and live.fibaeurope.com

Ids for fibalivestats.com and live.fibaeurope.com are available with this package.
You can get them by using `data()`

```R
#fibalivestats.com
data(""fibalivestats_matches_ids"")

#live.fibaeurope.com
data(""livefibaeurope_matches_ids"")
```

# Download stats tables from realgm.com

Stats tables with teams or players stats. You can download different types of
stats such as: Totals, Advanced Stats, Averages, Per48, Per40, Per36, Miscellaneous.

```R
#get available realgm.com leagues
get_realgm_league_names()

#download teams stats
get_team_stats_realgm(league = 'Spanish ACB', season = 2017, type = 'Totals')
get_team_stats_realgm(league = 'Polish TBL', season = 2014, type = 'Advanced_Stats', split = 'Team_Starters')

#download players stats
get_players_stats_realgm(league = 'Israeli BSL', season = 2014, type = 'Advanced_Stats')
get_players_stats_realgm(league = 'German BBL', season = 2016, type = 'Totals', position = 'PG')
```

# Download scores and box scores from realgm.com
Scores and box scores from european league for given period of time.
Date format is YYYY-MM-DD.

```R

Making NCAA March Madness predictions
-------------------------------------
**It's about that time of year again!**

Time to fill out a bracket and pick the best college basketball team in America.

_But, how should we pick who wins?_

Tons of very smart people spend an inordinate amount of time trying to answer exactly this question. Nate Silver's website [FiveThirthyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/) does a good job of showing probabilities of any team winning the tournament.

_So why the beef with Nate, dog?_

Most of his predictions _(as well as others')_ rely heavily on stats like BPI, Power Ratings, and Elo scores which are themselves based mostly on the ranking of the team going into the tournament. These rank-based stats take many names, sometimes it's ""Strength of Schedule"", or ""Opponent Strength"". But those stats skip over the fact that they have not defined what determines highly ranked team to begin with.

![Circular Reasoning](https://github.com/whsky/smarter-than-nate-silver/blob/master/README_images/CircularReasoning.png?raw=true)

So, models built on this information lean toward picking a winning team based on who is the better seed. You can see this effect based on who [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/sports/) has picked to be in the Final Four from the last couple of tournaments:

|**Year**|**Team**|**Seed**|**Made Final Four**
-----|-----|-----|:-----:|-----
2016|Kansas|1|No
||UNC|1|Yes
||Mich. St.|2|No
||Oklahoma|2|Yes
2015|Kentucky|1|Yes
||Villanova|1|No
||Duke|1|Yes (won championship)
||Arizona|2|No
2014|Florida|1|Yes
||Arizona|1|No
||Louisville|4|No
||Mich. St.|4|No


Hmmmm...that seems to be a lot of No.1 seeds. Perhaps they are seeded higher because they are the better team, so we _should_ use this number, right?

Not exactly, ranking and placing teams in the opening round of the tournament is far more complicated, and even worse, dependent on a panel to decide where each team should rank.

A Rank Agnostic Approach
------------------------

Why not just ignore the rankings, and mine through historical data to evaluate team performance based solely on player-level data?

We can then use this game data to predict the outcome of future matches based on the patterns seen in the historical data. Machine Learning techniques like Neural Nets do a great job of finding these type of patterns. So let's build a Multilayer Perceptron to take player data from regular season game data to predict the margin of victory _(the point-spread)_ of post-season games like the March Madness tournament.

This data was scraped for every game that had complete boxscores for the last decade using my `scrapey.py` file in this repo. Also, csv files for player data of each season are available in the `data` folder.

**What is a point-spread?**

Point-spreads were introduced by [Charles K. McNeil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_K._McNeil) _(who later became JFK's math teacher)_ as an attempt to balance out betting between both outcomes. For example, if **Team 1** is a strong favorite to beat **Team 2**, you would expect that a majority of the bets will be for **Team 1** to win. This is a huge disadvantage to whomever is taking the bet. If **Team 1** wins, they have a massive amount of payouts to make. But, if we make the bet over whether **Team 1** will win _by more than an certain number of points_ rather than just if they will win. We now can move this handicap to persuade bets to take one side or the other and thus keep an even number of bets on both sides.

_Wait, why would the people taking the bet want an even number on both sides?_

Great question, because they want to minimize their exposure to risk. With balanced betting they can trust that regardless of the outcome, there is no risk of one side having to pay out more than the other. Don't worry though, they still get a piece of every bet they see, so they still make money.

Neural Nets
-----------

Neural Nets _(NN)_ adapt to the data being feed into them. They are adapting to what they see in relation to the desired outcome. This adaptation of the model is why these methods are referred to as Machine Learning. The model changes a neuron's weighted input that minimizes the error between the model output and desired output.

To build the Multilayer Perceptron NN I used Keras and followed a lot of what Jason Brownlee blogged about on [Machine Learning Mastery](http://machinelearningmastery.com/regression-tutorial-keras-deep-learning-library-python/). Because we are concerned with predicting point_spreads, this is a regression model. I used a deep network in the hopes that it would allow the NN to find more interactive patterns in the player stats, like an underlying synergy or ""team-i-ness"". I tested just under 100 different parameter tweaks (e.g. number of hidden layers, width of input layer, activation function, and epoch/batch sizes). Using the following model I achieved the lowest RMSE and highest percentange of correct calls on game winner:

```python
def baseline_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(200, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',
        activation='softsign'))
    model.add(Dense(75, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',
        activation='softsign'))
    model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',
        activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, init='uniform'))

    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
    return model
```


2017 March Madness
------------------

This same approach was used to model data from the 2016-2017 dataset. Results of all predictions _(all 351 tems playing each other, roughly 62,000 predictions)_ were computed and dumped into a python `dict` which allows fast access to results without the unnecessary re-modeling and re-predicting. Because `dict`s are hash-mapped, they are also incredible fast and web-friendly since they resemble JSON elements. These predictions get served over the web using a Flask app which you can find here: [SmarterThanNateSilver.com](http://smarterthannatesilver.com)

After **""Selection Sunday""** on March 12th, I will be filling out a bracket with choices made solely by my model, as well as predicted results for daily match-ups throughout the tournament.

I have also modified this model to conform to Kaggle's ""March Machine Learning Mania"" so you can track how well it's holding up against other Data Science Nerds:

CS 231 Project Winter 2014

Project to perform single-view 3D reconstruction of basketball scenes
using commonly available TV footage of games.

Our main objective is to identify location of court relative to camera.

Source code is located in the `src` directory:

* To get an understanding of how the 4-point selection works, look at
  `image_object.py`, which calls most other files.
  (This script can be run without arguments.)
* The homography estimation is done in `homography.py`.
	(This script can be run without arguments.)
* Frame extraction is done in `extract_frames.py`.
	(This script requires arguments, which you can find by running with `-h`.)

Tactics and statistics in professional basketball teams are widespread. This operation can be optimized and speed up by
an automatic computer vision system. We aim at developing such system capable of action tracking and understanding in
basketball games using computer vision approaches and ideas alongside deep learning models such as Detectron2. Our
system tracks player trajectories from videos and rectifies them to a standard basketball court, showing also the player
who owns the ball.

# *nbapy - [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com) API for python*

## Summary
A python facing API for `stats.nba.com`

***Warning*** `stats.nba.com` is notorious for being extremely unreliable. Please report any issues you find.

## Usage

All data is returned as a pandas dataframe (check out the [starter docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) if you're new to pandas). For example:

```python
from nbapy import game
import pandas as pd

game_id = '0021900017'  # taken from 'https://stats.nba.com/game/0021900017/'
stats = game.BoxScore(game_id).players_stats()
print(stats)
```

If you want to cache results so you don't have to reach the api every time, you can use [requests-cache](https://pypi.org/project/requests-cache/)
```python
from nbapy import game
import pandas as pd
import requests_cache

requests_cache.install_cache('nbapy_cache')

game_id = '0021900017'
stats = game.BoxScore(game_id).players_stats()
print(stats)
```

## Documentation
A constant work-in-progress, but [check them out](https://nbapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!


## Installation
To install from pypi:

```bash
$ python -m pip install nbapy
```

## Contributing
#### 1. Fork the repository and create a feature/bug fix branch

#### 2. Install development requirements

You will to first install [poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) if you don't already have it.
```bash
$ python -m pip install poetry
```

After that, just run `poetry install` inside of your fork.

#### 3. Hack away

*Coding conventions*

* [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
* [google docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html#quickstart) for linting
* [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static typing analysis
* [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit style.
* [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/) for import organization.

Whew, that's a lot, but I'm a big fan of clean code, and I hope you are too! The good news is that if you follow the following advice, you'll find these aren't too hard to manage :smile:

*Optional (but recommended)*

`nbapy` has a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) file that you can install to automatically enforce these conventions prior to committing via a git hook.

To install: `$ pre-commit install`

You can also use `$ pre-commit run -a` to run the checks manually.

For commit messages, I recommend using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen). It is automatically installed in the dev dependencies, so to commit, you just run `cz c` and follow the prompts.

If you're using pre-commit, and either the black or isort check fails, the good news is it will fix the problems for you. However, it won't continue the commit automatically so that you get a chance to look over the changes. You'll have to re-stage the changes, and then you can run `cz c --retry` so you don't lose that nice commit message you just wrote.

#### 4. Create some tests

#### 5. Make sure everything looks good
`$ pytest --cov`* 

`$ sphinx-build -n -W -q -b html docs docs/_build/html`

`$ pre-commit run -a` (if you didn't install the pre-commit git hook)

\* note the first time you run this, it may take a few minutes. However, the requests will cache, and subsequent runs should be much faster.

#### 6. Submit a pull request

Other ways to contribute involve submitting any issues or adding some documentation!

## To-Do
- Finish Jupyter Notebook documentation

## Authors

This is orginally based off of https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py so a lot of the work was done by those guys. My goal with this project is to clean up the code, add some proper documentation, and keep it up to date.

### Setup Environment

Make sure you have installed:

- [Node 5](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- NPM 3 *(packaged with Node)*
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

#### Installing PostgreSQL on OSX

On a Mac, the easiest way to install and configure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
is using the [brew](https://brew.sh/) utility:

```
brew install postgresql
```

Pay special attention to the end of the [brew](https://brew.sh/) command's
output, which includes instructions on how to start `postgres`:

```
To load postgresql:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
```

The provided `launchctl` command ensures the `postgres` process is always
running, even after a system restart. The alternative `postgres` command
starts the `postgres` process manually.

We recommend the `launchctl` option. If desired, `postgres` can be
stopped and uninstalled by running:

```
brew uninstall postgresql
```

#### Installing PostgreSQL on Linux

*Coming Soon*

#### Installing PostgreSQL on Windows

Download and use the graphical installer available on [postgresql.org](http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/). Make sure you host it listen to port `5432`.

Open `pg_hba.conf`, which should be in _C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5\data_, and change from `md5` authentication to `trust`. For example, change:

> host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

to:

> host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust

`trust` should not be used in a production environment.  We are only using it here as a substitute for the `peer` mode available in UNIX environments. Read more about it [here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/auth-methods.html).



Finally, using `pgAdmin III` graphical database manager, which should have been installed with `postgres`, create a `bitballs` database.


### Download Source

Clone this repo using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/donejs/bitballs.git
```

Navigate to the repository's directory

```
cd bitballs
```

### Prepare the Database

Make sure the `postgres` process is running:

```
ps | grep postgres
```

You should see ""postgres -D"" among the output:

```
92831 ttys000    0:00.02 postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
92856 ttys000    0:00.00 grep postgres
```

With that confirmed we can create the database that the bitballs app
will persist its data to:

```
createdb bitballs
```

### Install Dependencies

To install the project's JavaScript dependencies run:

```
npm install
```

Additionally DoneJS's command line utilities need to be installed globally:

```
npm install -g donejs-cli
```

### Start the Server

With all the prerequisite setup completed the server can be started by running:

```
donejs develop
```

### Register a User

Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/register](http://localhost:5000/register)
in your browser and follow the instructions.

### Enjoy

You're finished! Explore some of the app's features:

- Live reload (`donejs develop`)
- Run the tests (`donejs test`)
- Generate the documentation (`donejs document`)

# Home Screen:

When the program is launched from `BasketballMain` the **Home Screen** is created and is
shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/GetPlayersPanelwPlayers.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Home Screen"">
</p>

## Buttons and Labels:
Icon | Component Name | Description
--- | :---: | ---
<img src = ""Image/submit.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Add Player Icon""> | **Add Player** | Adds the player name entered in the text field. 
<img src = ""Image/undo.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Undo Icon""> | **Undo** | Removes the most recently added player.
<img src = ""Image/player.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Player Icon""> | **Players** | The players entered by the user. The most recently added player appears at the top of the list.
<img src = ""Image/start.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Start Game Icon""> | **Start Game** | Becomes enabled when the user enters the minimum required players. The default minimum is 5, however the user can change this in the **Settings**.
<img src = ""Image/oldGames.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Old Games Icon""> | **Old Games** | Loads any games previously tracked using this software. In the case of a crash or unwanted closure of the program, statistic tracking can resume without any concerns.
<img src = ""Image/instructions.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Instructions Icon""> | **Instructions** | Opens a new window with the documentation for the program. There is text that walks the user through all the components of the program and has interactive panes where the user can become familiar with the mechanics of the program. 
<img src = ""Image/settings.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Settings Icon""> | **Settings** | Allows user to change the rules governing gameplay and the background color of the program while they use it.
<img src = ""Image/close.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Close Icon""> | **Close** | Closes the program.

## Settings Window:
The settings window features several Radio Button groups to change the configurations of the game. There is also the option of changing the background color of the program. The settings window is shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/SettingsWindow.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Settings Window"">
</p>

***
# Starter Selection:

If the number of players entered in the **Home Screen** is greater the number
of starters selected in the settings window, then you will need to choose
who will start in your game. 

Clicking on the player names will add them to a list of players currently
selected to start the game. You will only be able to start the game
once you have selected the appropriate number of starters.

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/StartersPanelwPlayers.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Starters Selection"">
</p>

## Buttons and Labels:
Icon | Component Name | Description
--- | :---: | ---
<img src = ""Image/undo.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Undo Icon""> | **Undo** | Removes the most recently added starter.
<img src = ""Image/start.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Start Game Icon""> | **Start Game** | Becomes enabled when the correct number of starters have been entered. Opens a **Roster Management** window.
<img src = ""Image/close.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Close Icon""> | **Close** | Closes the **Starter Selection** window.
***
# Roster Management

If the number of players entered equals the number of starters specified (either by default or in
the settings) then you will be directed to this window after clicking the Start Game
button in the **Home Screen** or if the game you are loading with the **Old Games**
button had as many players as starters specified. 

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/ManagementPanelNoBench.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Roster Management"">
</p>

If the number of players entered was greater than the number of starters specified, then you were redirected to the **Starter Selection** window where you chose your starters. Once you pressed the **Start Game** button there, you will be redirected to an alternate version of the **Roster Management** window with starters and a bench. Players who foul out of the game have their button marked red and disabled. If the foul that got that player ejected is removed through the **Undo** Button, then that player's button will become enabled and will be colored light gray to show they are back on the bench and can be substituted in. If only five players remain (or however many starters were specified in the **Settings**) due to player ejections or injuries, then no player that has fouled out will be allowed into the game, contrary to the NBA Rule where the first player who fouled out comes back into the game.

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/ManagementPanelwBench.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Roster Management with Bench"">
</p>

## Buttons and Labels:
Icon | Component Name | Description
--- | :---: | ---
<img src = ""Image/score.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Score Icon""> | **Score** | Shows the total points scored by the team.
<img src = ""Image/boxscore.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Box Score Icon""> | **Box Score** | Opens a new window showing all player statistics in the traditional Box Score format used for Basketball Games.
<img src = ""Image/undo.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Undo Icon""> | **Undo** | Opens a new window allowing the user to correct any statistics they entered by deleting them. All periods of the game are shown and clicking on a period shows the user all statistics that were entered during that period. Clicking on any statistic closes the Undo window and removes that statistic.
<img src = ""Image/done.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Done Icon""> | **Done** | Stops the game and closes the **Roster Management** window.
<img src = ""Image/play.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Play Button Icon""> | **Start/Stop** | Starts/Stops the timer for the game.
<img src = ""Image/timeout.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Pause Button Icon""> | **Timeouts** | Takes away one timeout (Timeouts remaining shown on button) and stops the  timer.
<img src = ""Image/fouls.png"" width = ""50"" alt = ""Team Fouls Icon""> | **Team Fouls** | Shows the current number of team fouls in the period. Resets after each period.

## Box Score Button:

The window that appears when the **Box Score** Button is pressed. It shows all player statistics in the traditional 'Box Score' format. The table is shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/BoxScoreTable.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Box Score Table"">
</p>

## Player Buttons:

There are some additional features in the **Roster Management** window. When a player's button is clicked (who is on the court), a new window will open that allows the user to select from all possible statistics. Pressing on any statistic will increment that statistic for the given player by the correct amount. This window is shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/AddStatPanel.PNG"" width = ""600"" alt = ""Add Statistic to Player"">
</p>

Some statistics increment several other statistics when they are incremented:
1. Made FG
2. Made 3pt FG
3. OREB/DREB

For example, if a Made 3pt FG is selected, then **Points, Made FG, FGA, Made 3pt FG, and 3PA** are all incremented as well.

The program incorporates several features to make statistical tracking quicker during actual game play. Hotkeys are shown in square brackets for quicker statistic entries and several statistics have built in functionality to avoid redundancy. **Made Shots**, **Missed Shots** and **Blocks** will ask the user if the shot was **Assisted**, **Offensive Rebounded**, or **Defensive Rebounded** respectively. 

**For Example:** If the statistic is a missed shot, then the user is asked if the shot was rebounded by a teammate, if that is the case, then the user will be asked who got the reboudn. These windows are shown below:

Did a team member get the Offensive Rebound? | Who got the Rebound?
:---: | :---:
<img src = ""Screenshots/OffensiveRebounded.PNG"" width = ""410"" alt = ""Offensive Rebound Question Frame""> | <img src = ""Screenshots/WhoGotTheOffensiveRebound.PNG"" width = ""410"" alt = ""Who got the offensive rebound?"">


If the **Roster Management** window has a bench panel on it, then clicking on one of the players on the bench will open a window that will ask the user to substitute the player that was clicked into the game. The window is shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/PlayerSubstitution.PNG"" width = ""400"" alt = ""Player Substitution Window"">
</p>

## Undo Button:

If there was a mistake when entering a statistic, it is possible to undo this mistake with the **Undo** Button. When clicked, a window will open with a bar at the top allowing the user to chose from any period of the game. If that period has not yet started, then those buttons will be disabled. When the desired period button is clicked, a list of buttons will appear each showing the statistics entered in chronological order. Clicking on a statistic will close the window and remove that statistic. The window is shown below:

<p align = ""center"">
  <img src = ""Screenshots/UndoButton.PNG"" width = ""400"" alt = ""Undo Button Window"">

142,ddayto21/NBA-Time-Series-Forecasts,HTML,"# Repository Overview
The first section of this application involves scraping NBA statistics from Basketball Reference in order to train a machine learning model we can use to generate time-series predictions for each player, in regards to their chance of winning the MVP for a certain year. 

## Data Collection
We use Python to scrape data from Basketball Reference, a website that provides basketball statistics and player data from the past 30 years in the NBA. 

- Source: https://www.basketball-reference.com/
- Datasets: MVP Data, Player Statistics, Team Statistics

### Scraping MVP Data
The following block of code scrapes MVP data from the past 30 years (1991 to 2022), then creates an HTML file for each year. After we are finished webscraping, we will extract the relevant data from each HTML file, and convert those files into individual CSV files.

```python
def Scrape_MVP():   
    years = range(1991, 2022)
    url_start = ""https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_{}.html""
    for year in years:
        url = url_start.format(year)
        data = requests.get(url)        
        with open(""mvp/{}.html"".format(year), ""w+"") as f:
            f.write(data.text)
```

### Scraping NBA Player Statistics
The webpages that contain NBA player statistics contain dynamic content, making it a challenge to scrape all of the data we need in order to train our machine learning model. However, we address this problem using a Selenium chrome driver in order to loa  block of code scrapes MVP data from the past 30 years (1991 to 2022), then creates an HTML file for each year. After we are finished webscraping, we will extract the relevant data from each HTML file, and convert those files into individual CSV files.

### Preparing Datasets - CSV Files
After collecting the MVP data from the past 30 years, we iterate every year in our 'mvp' folder and apply the following operations to each HTML file:
- Create an empty array that will be used to store multiple dataframes
- Extract relevant information from each HTML file, specifying the 'id' attribute of the table we need.
- Use Pandas to read the HTML table using Pandas as a dataframe
- Create a CSV file in the ""mvp"" folder using the .to_csv() operation 

```python
def Parse_MVP(years):
    dfs = []
    years = range(1991, 2022)
    for year in years:
        with open(f""mvp/{year}.html"") as f:
            page = f.read()
        soup = BeautifulSoup(page, ""html.parser"")
        soup.find('tr', class_=""over_header"").decompose()
        mvp_table = soup.find(id=""mvp"")
        mvp_df = pd.read_html(str(mvp_table))[0]
        mvp_df[""Year""] = year        
        dfs.append(mvp_df)
    mvps = pd.concat(dfs)
    mvps.to_csv(""mvp/mvps.csv"")    
```

## Machine Learning
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms. 


### Ridge Regression
Ridge regression is a regularization technique that performs L2 regularization. It modifies the loss function by adding the penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.

```python
  train = stats[stats[""Year""] < 2021]
  test = stats[stats[""Year""] == 2021]
  reg = Ridge(alpha=.1)
  reg.fit(train[predictors], train[""Share""])
  predictions = reg.predict(test[predictors])
  predictions = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=[""Predictions""], index=test.index)

### Contribute

Have a request or find a bug? This project is completely open source, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

The project uses a variety of [tools](./data) (incl. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/), [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and [cairosvg](http://cairosvg.org/)) to aggregate logo images and player data. This data is served from a public domain (http://nba.kshvmdn.com) and used within the application. If you're interested in local development, you generally _shouldn't_ need to worry about this stuff though.

144,nuno-faria/HeadToHead,C#,"![logo](ReadmeResources/logo.png)

An arcade 1v1 football(soccer)/volley/basket game (single or local multiplayer). It can be played online [here](https://nuno-faria.itch.io/headtohead). It was made using the Unity game engine.



## Gameplay

The gameplay is straightforward: two players try to get the ball on the opposition's goal; the winner of the game is the one that reaches the goal limit first (if a limit was set).


### Demo

![demo](ReadmeResources/demo.gif)


### Game Modes

There are three game modes available: football, volley and basket.

#### Football

<img src=""ReadmeResources/football.png"" width=""60%"">

#### Volley

<img src=""ReadmeResources/volley.png"" width=""60%"">

There is a 7 second limit for how long the ball can be in the same area.
If the limit is exceeded, the other player scores a point.

#### Basket

<img src=""ReadmeResources/basket.png"" width=""60%"">


### Abilities

The game offers three different abilities:

- **Kick** - kick the ball, with a specific power and direction;
<img src=""ReadmeResources/kick.gif"" width=""40%"" style=""margin-bottom: 20px"">

- **Lift** - lift the ball (90 degrees angle);
<img src=""ReadmeResources/lift.gif"" width=""40%"" style=""margin-bottom: 20px"">

- **Stop** - stop the ball;
<img src=""ReadmeResources/stop.gif"" width=""40%"" style=""margin-bottom: 20px"">


## Controls

Both the keyboard and the controller are supported, although the controller is recommended way to play. The input used can be changed in the 'Controls' menu.

<img src=""ReadmeResources/controls.png"" width=""40%"">

The menu can be navigated both with the mouse and the keyboard/controller. The goal limit can be changed selecting the input field and entering the number or using the vertical keys (W,S,up,down,LB).


## AI

The player's AI was implemented using the concept of **decision trees**. But instead of writing the functions and all the ifs/elses needed, it was used a YAML file to specify the tree. This file is then parsed by a Python script, that converts it to C# code. With this, the AI can be written faster (less boilerplate code) and it's easier to understand/manage.

### Specification

A specification file has three main fields:
- **include** - other specification files to include (relative path);
- **expressions** - aliases for expressions to be used in the nodes' specification;
- **nodes** - specification of the tree:
    - **info** - what the node does (to serve as documentation);
    - **action** - instructions to be executed before the decision is made (ex: setting variables);
    - **decision** - logic expression;
    - **yes** - nodes to execute (can be multiple) when the decision is true (or there is no decision);
    - **no** - nodes to execute (can be multiple) when the decision is false.


There are two dictionaries that must be provided to the tree:
- `state` - the state of the game;
- `data` - (empty) dictionary to set variables (to be used to pass the result and/or to use internally).

For example, let's say we want to create an AI that just follows the ball. The state provides us with the ball and the player's position. We could implement this AI like so (this could be simplified even further by having an action like `data[""move""] = state[""playerPosX""] - state[""ballPosX""] < 0 ? 1 : -1`, it's just a simple illustrative example):

```yaml
expressions:
    # the expression is not needed, it's used just to make the code more readable
    left_of_ball: state[""playerPosX""] < state[""ballPosX""]

nodes:
    ROOT:
        info: Is the player to the left of the ball?
        decision: left_of_ball # or state[""playerPosX""] < state[""ballPosX""]
        yes: MOVE_RIGHT; SPRINT
        no: MOVE_LEFT; SPRINT

    MOVE_LEFT: data[""move""] = -1
    # same as
    # MOVE_LEFT:
    #    action: data[""move""] = -1

    MOVE_RIGHT: data[""move""] = 1

    # the SPRINT node could be a ROOT action, since it's simple and always used
    SPRINT: data[""sprint""] = 1
```

This results in the following tree (using the Assets/Scripts/AI/plot_specification.py script):

<img src=""ReadmeResources/sample_tree.png"" width=""100%"">

#### Trees Used

##### Football


<img src=""Assets/Scripts/AI/plots/FootballTree.png"" width=""100%"">

##### Volley

<img src=""Assets/Scripts/AI/plots/VolleyTree.png"" width=""100%"">

##### Basket

<img src=""Assets/Scripts/AI/plots/BasketTree.png"" width=""100%"">


### Execution

The structure is converted in instructions that adds the nodes to a tree, starting with the leaves and ending with the root. In runtime, the game `state` is passed to the tree, as well as the `data` dictionary. The result is provided using the reference to the `data`."

**Authors:** Michał Szachniewicz [(szacho)](https://github.com/szacho), Anna Klimiuk [(Stardust87)](https://github.com/Stardust87)

This project automates the process of extracting a basketball trajectory from a video. It saves results and creates a pretty visualization:

![visualization of detected trajectory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szacho/basketball-detection/main/assets/output_123629AA.gif)
![visualization of detected trajectory 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szacho/basketball-detection/main/assets/output_test_163955AA.gif)

The algorithm used for object detection is YOLO, forked from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. It has been trained on a custom dataset of privately recorded videos. The whole process is automated and it can handle a directory of videos one by one. 

## Evaluation of the model
The test set was created from two sceneries. Scenery *0* was present in a training set, but different recordings were used. Scenery *1* was completely new to the model. Every video was split into 4 categories:
- *in_hands* - the ball is in or near the hands of a player
- *in_air* - the ball was thrown and is in the air until it hits something
- *near_basket* - the ball is close to the basket or even going through one (it can be occluded by a rim etc.)
- *bouncing* - the ball is bouncing on the ground 

Furthermore, an additional category *custom* was added and it consisted of different images from the internet to assure that the model can generalize well.  We evaluated the performance of the model on every scenery and category by intersection over union and distance error between (x_true, y_true) and (x_pred, y_pred) in pixel space.

Full results are available in the *yolo_analysis* notebook. In short: predictions are very accurate -- the average error in the distance for unseen scenery was equal to only 1.3px! That is comparable to human error.

Below are grouped per scenery and per category boxplots of IoU and distance error on the test set.

<!-- badges: end -->

[**`toRvik`**](https://github.com/andreweatherman/toRvik) is an R package for working with and scraping men's college basketball.

There are a lot of college basketball data out there, but most are difficult to pull and clean or they are behind a paywall. With `toRvik`, you have immediate access to some of the most detailed and extensive college basketball statistics publicly available -- all returned in tidy format with just a single line of code! Best of all, no subscription is required to access the data.\
\
Most of `toRvik`'s functions are powered by a dedicated Fast API framework -- delivering data at rapid speeds with dependable up-times.

As of version 1.0.3, the package includes nearly 30 functions for pulling player and team data, game results, advanced metric splits, play-by-play shooting, and more. Leveraging the same data and models as [Barttorvik](https://www.barttorvik.com), the package now offers game and tournament predictor functions, allowing you to simulate games between any pair of teams on any date at any venue back to the 2014-15 season. `toRvik` also offers extensive transfer histories for over 5,000 players back to the 2011-12 season and detailed player recruiting rankings for over 6,000 players back to 2007-08.

## Package Installation

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(toRvik)
```


Install the released version of `toRvik` from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(""toRvik"")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace('devtools', quietly = TRUE)){
  install.packages('devtools')
}
devtools::install_github(""andreweatherman/toRvik"") 
```

## Package Highlights

-   Detailed game-by-game + season-long statistics by player and split
-   Extensive transfer + recruiting histories
-   Custom game and tournament predictions
-   Shooting splits + shares by team
-   Game box scores for all D-1 games
-   Team + conference four factors by split
-   Game-by-game four factors
-   NCAA committee-style team sheets
-   D-1 head coaching changes

## Basic Uses

All `toRvik` functions fall into one of six categories:

-   **Rating**, pulling and slicing T-Rank + four factor data
-   **Player**, pulling player data and histories
-   **Team**, pulling team statistics and histories
-   **Game**, pulling game-by-game data and schedules
-   **Tournament**, pulling raw and adjusted tournament performance
-   **Miscellaneous**

### Pull T-Rank ratings:

Calling `bart_ratings` will return the current T-Rank ranks and ratings.

```{r}
head(bart_ratings())
```

### Pull team statistics

Calling `bart_factors` will return four factor stats on a number of splits. To filter by home games, set venue to 'home.'

```{r}
head(bart_factors(location='H'))
```

Calling `bart_team_box` will return team box totals and per-game averages by game type. To find how Duke performed during the month of March:

```{r}
bart_team_box(team='Duke', split='month') |>
  dplyr::filter(month=='March')
```

### Pull player statistics

Calling `bart_player_season` will return detailed season-long player stats. To pull per-game averages for Duke players:

```{r}
head(bart_player_season(team='Duke', stat='box'))
```

Calling `bart_player_game` will return detailed game-by-game player stats. To pull advance splits by game for Duke players:

```{r}
head(bart_player_game(team='Duke', stat='advanced'))
```

### Pull transfer histories

Calling `transfer_portal` will return transfer histories with matching player IDs to join with other statistics. To find all players who transferred to Duke:

```{r}
head(transfer_portal(to='Duke'))
```

### Pull recruiting rankings

Calling `player_recruiting_rankings` will return extensive recruit histories with matching player IDs. To find all 5-star players who played high school basketball in North Carolina:

```{r}
head(player_recruiting_rankings(stars=5, state='NC'))
```

### Predict games and tournaments

Calling `bart_game_predictions` will returns expected points, possessions, and win percentage for a given game on a given date. To simulate North Carolina at Duke in mid-January:

```{r}
bart_game_prediction('Duke', 'North Carolina', '20220113', location = 'H')
```

Calling `bart_tournament_prediction` will simulate a single-elimination tournament between a group of teams on a given date. To simulate the 2022 Final Four 25 times:

```{r}
bart_tournament_prediction(teams = c('Duke', 'North Carolina', 'Kansas', 'Villanova'), '20220402', sims = 25, seed = 10)
```

## What is Basketball?
Basketball is a self-hosted alternative to the quite pricey Dribbble Playbook. Playbook is a portfolio site which automatically displays your Dribbble Shots, and that's what Basketball can also do! It's easier than manually uploading all your shots to a portfolio site, and also it just looks cool to have a custom portfolio with a custom domain. Of course, Basketball is hackable, so you can create your own themes or do more with the Dribbble API.

151,aistairc/rotowire-modified,Python,"# Rotowire-modified

Script for generating the rotowire-modified dataset for Learning to Select, Track, and Generate for Data-to-Text (Iso et al; ACL 2019).

## Data
This script generates the dataset ""rotowire-modified"" by extracting required data from the original rotowire dataset. 
We are not allowed to distribute the dataset itself due to the copyright issue, so we distribute only the script. 
The new dataset generated by this script is almost the same as, but not identical to the dataset used in the paper (Iso et al; ACL 2019). 
ACL's dataset contains 14 games that do not appear in the original rotowire and have to be obtained from https://www.rotowire.com and https://www.nba.com. 
Further information of the 14 games is listed in additional_games.txt.
In addition, there are a number of slight differences in data records due to the update of the original pages. 
For empirical comparison by other researchers, we also distribute the experimental result on this new rotowire-modified dataset at the [sports-reporter](https://github.com/aistairc/sports-reporter) repo.

#### Statistic of the datasets
|Data|Train|Validation|Test|Total|
|----|-----|----------|----|-----|
|rotowire (Wiseman'2017)|3398|727|728|4853|
|rotowire-modified (Iso et al; ACL 2019)|2714|534|500|3748|
|rotowire-modified (This repo)|2705|532|497|3734|

## Format

Since this script simply removed duplicate records from the original dataset, the data format is the same as that of the original rotowire dataset.
Please refer to [boxscore-data](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data) repo.

## Usage

You can download the original dataset (Wiseman'2017) from the [boxscore-data](https://github.com/harvardnlp/boxscore-data) repo, 
and then, transform it as bellow.
The script will create a directory ""rotowire-modified"", which contains train.json, valid.json, and test.json files.

152,SravB/NBA-Predictive-Analytics,Python,"# NBA Predictive Analytics

As Fall 2017 Exam Season reaches its climax, I did what any other university student would do - make a side project! 

From any NBA match, you can tell that many basketball players have a unique style of play. We have players like Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving dominating the 3-point range or like LeBron James and Russell Westbrook who devastate their opponents near the rim. 

But avid NBA fans know these characteristics out of instinct after watching the NBA for weeks, months, maybe even years. I wanted to find a concrete method of arriving at these conclusions. This led me to create a Python program which analyzes any current NBA player's gameplay to find which areas of the court they have most shooting success and the probability of shooting from certain spots. With this analysis, it can allow coaches and players to know their opponents gameplay and can show them which areas of the court to prioritize their defense.

![Screenshot](images/Jordan.jpg)



## How It Works

Using datasets from Kaggle (formatted with Pandas), we can use Matplotlib to illustrate our data analysis. This dataset includes every shot taken in the 2016-2017 Regular Season so any player who played a game during this season can be analyzed. By incorporating machine learning through Python's Scikit-Learn (using a K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier) we can also simulate a player's shooting from every position on the court. 

I incorporated multiple methods of analyzing shooting habits so let's take a look!



## Stephen Curry Shooting Analysis

![Screenshot](images/Stephen_Curry_Shots.jpg)

Let's start off with the two time MVP from the Golden State Warriors, Stephen Curry. In this plot, the green dots represent scoring shots while the red dots represent missed shots. The black dots represent spots that Curry is most likely to shoot from. The size of the dots represent the relative probability of Curry shooting from that position and the darkness of the dot illustrates his shot accuracy from that spot (with darker shades representing a higher accuracy).

However, the black dots are a bit hard to see because of the green and red dots, so let's simplify the plot.



![Screenshot](images/Stephen_Curry_Shots2.jpg)

So how did we do? Our plot says that Curry is most likely to shoot from very close range (at layup distance) or from the 3-point range. Any NBA fans can verify the accuracy of this prediction since Curry is known for his 3-point shooting and his ability to rush past defenders for layups.

For our next analysis let's change things up and take a look at another player - Curry's teammate, Kevin Durant.



## Kevin Durant Shooting Analysis

![Screenshot](images/Kevin_Durant_Shots.jpg)

In this analysis we are incorporating machine learning by using a Decision Tree to simulate Kevin Durant's shooting throughout the court. With this analysis we have a more uniform distribution for our analysis so we can predict how Durant will shoot based on his past shooting habits. In this plot, the green dots represent scoring shots and the red dots represent missed shots. 

From this analysis we can determine that Durant is more dominant on the right side of the court (which is the case for right-handed players). He also is predicted to score with high consistency throughout the key and around the 3-point perimeter - another prediction which is confirmed by his known playing style.  

But we can take this one step further, let's compare Kevin Durant's shooting to the average NBA player.



![Screenshot](images/Kevin_Durant_Shots2.jpg)

Similar to how we simulated Kevin Durant's shooting with machine learning, we can use the data for all NBA players in the 2016-2017 Regular Season to find the shooting habits of the average NBA player. In this plot, green dots represent shots that Durant made but the NBA average player missed (meaning Durant is above average shooting at this positions). In contrast, the red dots represent shots that Durant missed but the average player scored (meaning Durant is below average at these spots). Additionally, the yellow dots represent neutral areas where both Durant and the average player scored or missed. 

From the plot, we can see that Durant is above average in the majority of the court. He dominates shooting throughout the key and around the 3-point range - once again aligning with his known game style. 



## How Did We Do?

Overall, our predictive models can predict NBA players' shooting habits with a high degree of effectiveness as seen from the analysis on Curry and Durant. We can determine exactly which areas a player is above average at shooting and which they are below. We can also predict where they are most likely to shoot from and their accuracy from these positions. With this data, NBA coaches can plan defense strategies with much higher precision. 

Try it out with your favourite NBA players!

## Install

```sh
npm i @jharrilim/balldontlie-client
```

## Usage

This library uses async generators for handling pagination. You may use this in conjunction with
[for-await-of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of)
to make multiple API requests. You may also request for one page at a time by awaiting `.next()`.

Axios is used interally, and axios configuration options may be passed into `.v1()` if needed.

> Warning: This API is rate limited. You may only make up to [60 requests per minute](http://www.balldontlie.io/#getting-started).

### Example with for-await-of

```js
import { BallDontLie } from '@jharrilim/balldontlie-client';

void async function main() {
    const v1Client = BallDontLie.v1();
    for await(const teams of v1Client.teams(0)) {
        // paginate through all the teams
        for(const team of teams) {
            console.log(team.full_name);
        }
    }
}().catch(console.error);
```

### Example with .next()

```js
import { BallDontLie } from '@jharrilim/balldontlie-client';

void async function main() {
    const v1Client = BallDontLie.v1();
    const teamGenerator = v1Client.teams(0, 10); // starting from 0, 10 per page
    
    const teams1 = (await teamGenerator.next()).value; // get the first 10 teams
    teams1.forEach(team => console.log(team.full_name));

    const teams2 = (await teamGenerator.next()).value; // get the next 10 teams after the first 10
    teams2.forEach(team => console.log(team.full_name));

}().catch(console.error);
```

More examples can be found in the [tests](./test/integration/api.test.ts).

**Live Example**
![](examples/live_basketball.gif)

## Motivation
Utilizing the SpaceJam Basketball Action Dataset [Repo](https://github.com/simonefrancia/SpaceJam), I aim to create a model that takes a video of a basketball game to classify a given action for each of the players tracked with a bounding box. There are two essential parts for this program: R(2+1)D Model (Can be any 3D CNN architecture) and the player tracking. The deep learning framework used to train the network was PyTorch and the machine used to train the model was the Nvidia RTX 3060ti GPU.

This is a demo video from the SpaceJam Repo.

[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEziTgHx4cA)

## Action/Video Classification
A pretrained baseline R(2+1)D CNN (pretrained on kinetics-400 dataset) from [torchvision.models](https://pytorch.org/vision/0.8/models.html) is used and further fine-tuned on the SpaceJam dataset. Any 3D CNN architecture can be used, but for this project it was decided that the R(2+1)D was a perfect balance in terms of number of parameters and overall model performance. It was also shown in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11248.pdf) that factorizing 3D convolutional filters into separate spatial and temporal dimensions, alongside residual learning yields significant gains in accuracy. The training was done at [train.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/train.py).

### Dataset
As mentioned above, the SpaceJam Basketball Action Dataset was used to train the R(2+1)D CNN model for video/action classification of basketball actions. The [Repo](https://github.com/simonefrancia/SpaceJam) contains two datasets (clips->.mp4 files and joints -> .npy files) of basketball single-player actions. The size of the two final annotated datasets is about 32,560 examples. Custom dataloaders were used for the basketball dataset in the [dataset.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/dataset.py).

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonefrancia/SpaceJam/master/.github/histogram.png)

#### Augmentations
After reading the thesis [Classificazione di Azioni Cestistiche mediante Tecniche di Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330534530_Classificazione_di_Azioni_Cestistiche_mediante_Tecniche_di_Deep_Learning), (Written by Simone Francia) it was determined that the poorest classes with examples less than 2000 examples were augmented. Dribble, Ball in Hand, Pass, Block, Pick and Shoot were among the classes that were augmented. Augmentations were applied by running the script [augment_videos.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/augment_videos.py) and saved in a given output directory. Translation and Rotation were the only augmentations applied. After applying the augmentations the dataset has 49,901 examples.

##### Rotate
![rotate](examples/0000000_flipped_rotate_330.gif)
##### Translate
![translate](examples/0000000_translate_32_0.gif)

### Training
The training was done at [train.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/train.py). The training was run for 25 epochs and with a batch size of 8. The model was trained with the classic 70/20/10 split. Where 70% of the data was use to train and 20% was used to validate the model. And, the rest of the 10% was used in the inference to test the final model. It was found that a learning rate of 0.0001 was better than a learning rate of 0.001.

#### Checkpointing
Both history and checkpointing is done after every epoch with [checkpoints.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/utils/checkpoints.py) in the utils directory.

### Validation and Evaluation
The final model was a R(2+1)D CNN trained on the additional augmented examples. For validation on the test set, the model at epoch 19 was used as it was the best performing model in terms of validation f1-score and accuracy. The model performs significantly better than the reported 73% in the thesis [Classificazione di Azioni Cestistiche mediante Tecniche di Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330534530_Classificazione_di_Azioni_Cestistiche_mediante_Tecniche_di_Deep_Learning), acheiving 85% for both validation accuracy and test accuracy. The confusion matrix was attained using the [inference.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/inference.py) code. Further analysis on predictions and errors is done on [error_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/error_analysis.ipynb) notebook.

#### Confusion Matrix 

**- 0: Block, 1: Pass, 2: Run, 3: Dribble, 4: Shoot, 5: Ball in Hand, 6: Defence, 7: Pick, 8: No Action, 9: Walk**

## Player Tracking 
All player tracking is done in [main.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/main.py). Players are tracked by manually selecting the ROI using the opencv TrackerCSRT_create() tracker. In theory, an unlimited amount of people or players can be tracked, but this will significantly increase the compute time. In the example above only 2 players, LeBron James (Offence) & Deandre Jordan (Defence) were tracked. A simple example of player tracking is available in [Basketball-Player-Tracker](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Player-Tracker).

## Output
After extracting the bounding boxes from TrackerCSRT_create(), a cropped clip of 16 frames is used to classify the actions. The 16 frame length clip is determined by the vid_stride (Set to 8 in the example video above) which is set in the cropWindows() function in [main.py](https://github.com/hkair/Basketball-Action-Recognition/blob/master/main.py). Within the cropped window time frame the action is displayed on top of the bounding boxes to show the action of the tracked player.

## Future Additions
- Separate augmented examples from validation and only in training.
- Utilize better player tracking methods. 
- Restrict Box size to 176x128 (Or with similar Aspect Ratio), so resize of image is not applied.
- Fully automate player tracking. Potentially using YOLO or any other Object Detection Models.
- Play around with hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch size, layers frozen, etc.
- Try various 3D-CNN Architectures or sequential models such as CONV-LSTMs.
- Improve model to +90% accuracy and f1-score.

Note:
- The Model does not perform well with off-ball actions for some reason. Often times, the defender is classified to be dribbling when they are not. This might be because of the similarity of the stance while dribbling the ball and playing defence. For both movements, players generally lower their torsos forward in order to lower their centre of gravity.

============
Ruby basketball simulation. Partial recreation of a BASIC college basketball simulation I wrote in the 1980s. Inspired by discussion about [The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences](http://bit.ly/1PkU2Qh): ""Kobe Bryant shooting a basketball is essentially flipping a coin."" Given seasons of NBA data, I can model those coin flips.

The project reads [NBA play-by-play game files](/) and builds a probability distribution. It uses the probability distribution and a model to simulate games. There is also a web app to browse imported data.

Game simulation is very simple. There is a ""home"" team and a ""visitor"" team, each with exactly equal chances, league-average to make field goals, block shots, etc. There isn't even the concept of players, yet! Even this simulation is interesting: given two perfectly-matched teams, ~10% of games are 20-point blowouts. Maybe there's [more than coin-flipping](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?p=11265) going on? An entire simulated season routinely produces at least one 50-win team and one 33-win team.

Install
=======
 * On OS X, just run bin/setup
 * [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * Postgres
 * `gem install bundler`
 * `bundle`
 * `cd web; npm install; npm run dist:dev`

Test

Model
=====
The model and simulation borrows concepts from [finite-state machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), Redux and [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulations.

Games are modeled as state machines. State is described by a small number of attributes (is the ball in play?, which team has the ball?, what period is it?, are free throws pending?). Each state has a set number of valid transitions to other states. Each transition also has a probability.

Taken together, a game is a chain of game states. This is, more or less, a Markov model and a Markov chain. See Markov below.

Terminology
-----------
Each game state is a Ruby [Possession](lib/play_by_play/model/possession.rb) class. Each transition between Possessions is a [Play](lib/play_by_play/model/play.rb). A [Simulation::Game](lib/play_by_play/simulation/game.rb) is a chain of Possessions.

A Game is a store of immutable Possessions and Plays. Each Play is a state transition that produces a new Possession. A new Possession can only be created by a Play.

In state machines, plays could also be considered actions or events. ""Possession"" is  nebulous in common usage. Here, it could also have been called a ""game"" or ""game state"".

The probability distribution is the probability that a transition (Play) will occur given a game state (Possession). It could also be called a transition matrix or a conditional probability distribution.

Only some transitions are valid from certain states. For example, steals can never occur when free throes are pending. All states are valid from each other. They are all ""accessible"" Markov states.

In some places, it is easier to express plays and possessions with symbols. For example: { ball_in_play: true, team: :home } => [ :turnover ] => { ball_in_play: true, team: :visitor }

Redux
-----
While not strictly a Redux app, the simulation uses the reducer, state, and action ideas from [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html). Possessions are immutable Redux states, Plays are actions, and the [GamePlay](lib/play_by_play/model/game_play.rb) play! method is a reducer. GamePlay.play!(possession, play) => possession is equivalent to Redux's function(previousState, action) => newState.

A Play is a record of an ""applied"" action, either from a real-world sample or a simulation. The Play key (:rebound, team: :defense) is the Redux action.

This is a handy way to model basketball games that leads to concise, testable model code.

System
------
The larger system accepts play-by-play JSON files as input and outputs Simulation::Game.
Input: historical state transitions. Output: chain of states

Modules:
 * Sample. Import JSON files from real world games.
 * Model. Abstract model of basketball game.
 * Simulation. Use probabilities from Sample to run Model to simulation a game or season of games.
 * View. Display Simulation output as text.
 * Web. Web UI.

Many modules have duplicate names (Game, Team), but these duplicates are different, though related concepts. Mixing those concepts makes for confusing code.

States
------
Possessions are game states at a point in time. Game state can be considered essentially infinite. Every combination of players, time remaining, score, fouls, etc. can produce different transition probabilities.

However, to model what is _possible_ is much more finite. The model uses just:
 * ball in play?
 * team has possession?
 * pending free throws?
 * pending technical free throws?

Taken in order, the states are exclusive, so game state can be reduced in [PlayMatrix](lib/play_by_play/model/play_matrix.rb) to just: technical free throws?, free throws?, team?, ball in play?, any time remaining?.

Games could be modeled as several concurrent game state machines. One each for possession, FTs, etc., but that isn't helpful in practice.

Simulation
----------
The simulation is inspired by the Monte Carlo method, but isn't really a Monte Carlo simulation. It could be considered a Monte Carlo generator run once. (And could be run multiple times to be a true Monte Carlo simulation).

The RandomPlayGenerator is a ""roulette wheel"". The model determines which slots (plays) are on the wheel. Historical sample data determines the width of those slots. Similar to [log5](https://web.archive.org/web/20140123014747/http://www.chancesis.com/2010/10/03/the-origins-of-log5).

Markov
------
Markov models and chains help build a game model, but they are tools for predicting the probability of future states, not for simulations. This simulation care about the *type* of transition for counting stats like points, field goals made, assists, and more.

Our model also has multiple transitions from two states. Typical Markov examples only have one transition between two states, because only the probability matters. Matrices also aren't very useful here, though there are good applications for [baseball strategy](http://www.pankin.com/markov/theory.htm).

Old game
========
The old BASIC game had a text box score and a scrolling play-by-log. Similar to what you might hear on the radio or view on [nba.com](http://stats.nba.com/game/#!/20160108/playbyplay/#qtr1). ""Coaches"" playing the game could sub players in and out, assign position, defensive assignments, and choose basic strategy (offense, defense, rebound, steals, set picks, pass).

First steps on the new simulation are to build a solid game model and feed it good data. With that in place, it should be possible to make a playable simulation.

166,Ed-Zh/Basketball-Analytics,Jupyter Notebook,"# Basketball-Analytics
Investigated quantitatively the optimal body mechanics for shooting basketball by employing pose estimation and sports theory.



## Background 

If there is one thing that I wish I had learned earlier in my ten years of experience in basketball, it is shot mechanics. 



Too often, when training for better performance, beginners put too much emphasis on the drills: ""I should complete 80 behind-the-back dribbles, 100 free throws, 50 three-pointers, etc."" Focusing on the drills usually means very little attention paid to their body mechanics during the moves. How much should I bend my knees? Should I contract my glute first or quad first? 



As a wise man once observed, ""form before strength,"" which means one should priortize body mechanics over brute force in most skill-intensive sports.  The attention to details and mind-muscle connection is often what sets professional players apart from street hoopers. But how can we learn from those superstars? What's the secret magic that helps them optimize their forms to achieve longer shooting range and higher explosiveness?



Though there are rule-of-thumbs about shooting forms, little quantitative work has been done regarding the underlying body mechanics. By employing pose estimation and sports theory, this project aims to unscramble to myth behind optimal shot mechanics in basketball. 



## Research Question

Different key muscle groups are activated at different time intervals when a player shoots. 

**What's the optimal timing and order for activating these muscle groups?** 



## Model Methodology

1. Use the *mediapipe* API to obtain the locations of each joint (e.g. ankle, knee, hip)
2. Connect neighbouring joints to model limbs (e.g. connecting hip and knee gives the line representing thigh)
3. Compute the angular acceleration at each joint using the limbs stemming from it (e.g. the rotational movement thigh and lower leg determines the angular acceleration at knee)
4. Estimate the activation of a specific muscle group using angular acceleration at the corresponding joint (e.g. glute corresponds to hip). This follows from the angular part of Newton's Second Law (angular acceleration proportional to torque)

## Addtional Functionality

1. Produce a graph describing the player's shot mechanics as muslce activation vs. time
2. Evaluate the efficiency of the shot as a score 
3. Give suggestions on how to improve the shot mechanics

Note: the speed and acceleration are in relative terms, scaled for comparision across players



## Codes

The *AnalyzerModule.py* file wraps an *Analyzer* class, the instance of which can be used to analyze a video of a player shooting. 

The *pipeline.py* file applies *Analyzer* to produce i) a slow-motion video tracking (at real time) the activation of each muscle groups and ii) a graph illustrating the graph. 

The *Scoring.py* file implements a scoring system to evaluate the efficiency of the player's shot mechanics.

167,jnebrera/Amateur_Basketball_Broadcasting,Python,"# Amateur Basketball Broadcasting Camera System

![](./images/Title.jpg ""Cover"")

# First software releases as of April 27th 2021

You can see the design and consideration in the [about section](https://github.com/jnebrera/Amateur_Basketball_Broadcasting/blob/main/about.md).

In this past week, both Sameer and me have found some time to finally work on the coding aspects of the project. In the repository you have both scripts.

Bear in mind this software needs a video recorded with a panoramic camera and some tunning for the specific playground.

My script is a refined version of Sameer's, but I have left out by now the recording of the video itself, thus the script is good to play with and see if the algorithmic ideas are right or not.

# The background

In both cases we create a static background by extracting some random frames from the video and averaging them. This system should be improved so it is able to work in a streaming fashion instead of loading from a recorded video. Also, it is hard to get a static image with no players in such facilities, specially if you consider changing lighting conditions and different baskets utilized, so I have discarded such option. This is an area of improvement.

# Motion detection

Motion detection is done every nth frame by substracting the background image. From there, only bigger than a limit area are considered. To those, the feet position is computed and seen if it is withing the playground area.

In the case of Sameer's, the center of gravity is computed just with the center of the feet. In my version, both the position and the area are considered. My alternative makes biggher rectangles weight more in the positioning decision (for example, multiple players detected as just one box, have significant weight as the area is big).

My version implements the idea of the [Automatic Camera Selection](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01835033/file/automatic-camera-selection.pdf) paper.

In my version, I believe there is a better way to compute it, working directly with arrays.

Also, might be interesting to apply some Non Maximum Substraction (NMS) to reduce false positives, but reality is, as those tend to happen were there are players, I'm not worried by this factor.

Still, the possibility of shapes entering the field while their feet are outside of it and not being related to the game (like coach or public) is clearly affecting the results if their body is partially boxed. In many cases the bounding box doesn't cover the whole body and it is within the field (for example, the upper torso). It would be very important to reduce this effect to the maximum by proper camera placement (in our lab unfortunately the bodies of the coaches clearly enter the field many times).

I just purchased a Jetson Nano 2GB Dev Kit. Hope that by using a more advanced motion detection mechanism while still being able to sustain the framerate, will improve this situation.

# The panning (April 29th)

I just commited a better panning system solving mostly the jitter in the movement. Now is quite smooth and in case of necessity, jumps forward faster. For sure it could be further improved by someone with PTZ management experience, but for now is ok.

# Async video capture

The last improvement to my version has been to make the reading of the video async. Performance improved from 16 to 24 FPS which is a huge boost. For the background computation I don't use it, but I'm not worried by now about that is it is only computed once in its current form and is outside of the hot code path.

What is more important, the same [VidGear](https://abhitronix.github.io/vidgear/v0.2.1-stable/) library provides methods to read video from a RTSP server (most CCTV cameras have one) and to send the final video to Youtube or Facebook using RTMP (which is the ultimate goal of the project). 

So not only we have improved performance, but found the way to easily support source and sink video streams !!!

# Discarded ideas

One way to speed up the center of gravity computation was to do it directly over the mask image. It does work, producing good results but surprisingly is slower that finding the contours and iterating over them, thus we discarded it.

Also, instead of using an static background image we tried to detect movement by substracting a prior frame. We tried both frame -1 and frame -skip but the results were too erratic (the problem of the coach being partially detected as within the field).

# Async video writing and others (As of May 4th)

Thanks to the help of VidGear's main developer, now the code is able to record the resulting video. In my Mac I get around 12FPS when eanbling recording. He also made some little improvements on other parts of the code.

# Things to do (We would love some help here)

1. Improve rectangle selection by applying some Non Maximum Suppresion
2. Improve center of mass calculation by using matrix operations after NMS
3. Apply bitmask to remove areas where we know movement detection is undesirable and could lead to many false positives (public)
4. Apply some correction to area computation based on the distance to the camera as further rectangles weight less than closer ones
5. Port code to Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB
6. Port code to Adlink Vizi-AI board based on Intel Myriad X

168,yankovai/College-Basketball-Prediction,Python,"College-Basketball-Prediction
=============================

Predict the outcome when division I college basketball teams compete. 
	
	- Uses historical data from the 2003-2013 NCAA DI basketball seasons for
	  training data.

	- Considers each team's strength of schedule, abilitiy of opponents, 
	  field goal percentage, defensive rebounds, fouls, three point percentage,
	  assists, turnovers, free throw shooting, ..., etc.  
	 
	- Uses difference in teams' cummultive statistics to learn which features
	  are most important in predicting game outcomes using a logistic regression
	  model. 


'cbb_acquire_team_data.py' 
--------------------------

The purpose of this python script is to obtain descriptive statistics of team 
performance from www.sports-reference.com/cbb. Team descriptive statistics are,
for example, points per game, free throw percentegae, and the number of blocks
per game. Within this file is a class called 'CBB_Acquire_Team_Data', which 
accepts a span of years and a csv file name as input. This class scrapes the 
sports-reference site for descriptive statistics for every division I college
basketball team that played within the span of years input by the user. The 
results are output to the specified csv file. Each descriptive statistic will be
used as a feature in a predictive model.   

'cbb_acquire_game_data.py' 
--------------------------

Scrapes www.sports-reference.com/cbb for the results of all games played during 
some span of seasons. The user inputs the starting season, an end season, and a 
csv file name to a class named 'CBB_Acquire_Scoring_Data'. For every game in the
span of season the class will output the two teams playing and points scored by
each team to the specified csv file. The results are used to form the
classification in a predictive model.

'make_ratings_dict.py'
---------------------

Using the description in http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37, this
python script calculates several additional team descriptive statistics based on
the results from 'cbb_acquire_game_data.py'. Specifically, the statistics output
by the class 'Strength_of_Sched' summarize the degree of competion faced be each
team during a given season. The feature 'strength of schedule' accounts for how
easy or difficult a team's schedule has been. The feature 'margin' summarizes  a
team's margin of victory against all of its opponents. Finally, the feature
'rating' combines both the margin and strength of schedule of each team to
produce a coarse metric that can be used to rank all the teams. All the features
are output to a dictionary named 'ratings_dict.cpickle'.

'prepare_for_ml.py'
-------------------

Converts the raw data from www.sports-reference.com/cbb to data structures that
the libraries in scikit-learn can easily use. The ultimate result of the
routines included in this file is a numpy array containing all the features and
game results for the historical game data. The structure 'features.npz' contains
this output and is eventually loaded by scikit-learn. The features have not been
normalized. 

'make_predictions.py'
---------------------

Uses scikit-learn and historical game results to make predictions on college 
basketball games that have not been played. A logistic regression predictive 
model is created. Using this model, all the teams during the current season are
ranked by simulating the results when each team plays every other DI team.
Analysis of results can be output to csv files for further analyses in something
like Tableau.

# Does not work anymore because ESPN changed their website.

=========================================================================================================================================

ESPN Fantasy Basketball Daily Lineup Automator

This is my script to set my ESPN Fantasy Basketball lineup daily. Not fully automative as it does not add players off 
the bench and into the starting lineup if all the spots are taken, and of course, the players in those spots have games.
In that case, the script sends me an email with the amount of players who were unable to be added to the lineup.

# How to use

First, you'll need to install:
 - google-chrome
 - selenium webdriver

Next, clone or download the repository and extract the fntsylu folder. Now, open up the fntsylu.py file in any text editor and edit the following:
```python
 def login(self):
   // some code //
   username = """"  # Insert your email here
   password = """"  # Insert your password
   // rest of the code //
```
Before you edit this code, you'll need to create a gmail account that will notify you when there are players still on your bench. After you create the email, go back into the fntsylu.py file and edit the sendEmail function:
```python
 def sendEmail(self, players):
   // some code ///
   email = """"          # Insert the email you just created
   password = """"       # Insert the password for the email you just created
   recipientEmail = """" # Insert the email you want to be notified (your personal email)
   // rest of the code //
```
Next, you'll need to know your league ID and team ID in order to enter the command to run the script. 

Here's an example of correct command:
 > python fntsylu.py 7609 18 2018

'7609' is the ID of the league that I want to enter. '18' is the team ID. You can find your league and team ID by reading the url of the homepage of your fantasy league.'2018' is just the current year. Once you find your league and team IDs, go to your command line and change directory to the fntsylu folder, then type the following:
 > python fntsylu.py 'Insert your league ID here' 'Insert your team ID here' 'Insert your season ID here (current year)'

Chrome should open up and the script should be setting your lineup

# Crontab

Next, you can set up cron to run the command for you. In the terminal, type 
 > crontab -e 

And enter the following at the bottom of the crontab file:
 > 0 11 * * * export DISPLAY=:0; /usr/bin/python /path/to/fntsylu.py 'insert league id' 'insert team id' 'insert season id'

For the example line above, cron will run the script every day at 11.

172,djblechn-su/nba-player-team-ids,R,"# NBA Player and Team ID Database

## Intro

This project allows users to easily access a wide-variety of in-depth stats in one location. Currently, advanced NBA stats are spread out across various websites such as: ESPN, NBA.com, Basketball Reference and Spotrac. The main issue with the data being spread out is that it makes it especially difficult to scrape and analyze. Our project collects player IDs and puts them in one location. Thus, this will allow us to have all the advanced NBA metrics in one database that is easily accessible. All the data in one place leads to a reduction in the time it takes to scrape it. The new central location of the advanced metrics will allow for basketball statistics to be scraped more easily. Data is up-to-date as of the beginning of the 2019-2020 NBA season.

To scrape player data from each key basketball statistics website (https://stats.nba.com/, https://www.basketball-reference.com/, http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm, https://www.spotrac.com/nba/), we used R packages such as `rvest`, `XML`, and `RSelenium` to gather important information from each site. For each player we scraped their name (according to the site), link, ID (last few characters of link), and birth date (if available) to be able to match tables from different sites. Data was merged by name and birth date, but due to small differences in naming, some merging was done by hand. The corresponding code to scrape each website is provided, so we encourage users to utilize this code to scrape following years of data.

To gather the data necessary for identifying each team, we first went to every major basketball statistics website and examined the unique URLs of each team page on their respective websites. Then, we found what parts of the URL make each page unique from each other for the specific websites and logged those changes in excel. For example, the URL for the Los Angeles Clippers on basketball-reference is https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/, while the URL for the Los Angeles Lakers is https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/. We noted the difference at the end of each URL for each team, so that each URL would be accessible when plugging in the different endings, and did this for each website listed.

`gamezoneR` is an R package for working with NCAA Men's Basketball play-by-play data 
from STATS LLC's [GameZone](http://gamezone.stats.com/). The package allows users to scrape team and master schedules as well as play-by-play data with shot locations into a tidy format. The main benefit of `gamezoneR` is the volume of shot location data available. While ESPN also charts shots, as of March 10th 2021, ESPN has charted approximately 70,000 shots while STATS LLC has charted over 170,000 from the 2020-21 college basketball season alone!

## Installation

You can install `gamezoneR` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/JackLich10/gamezoneR) with:

``` r
# Install via devtools package using the following:

<a name=""introduction""></a><b>Introduction</b><br/>
Team: Eamon McNicholas & Alan Niemiec
With the aim of this module focusing on gestures we have decided to implement multiple gestures using a Basketball free throw game in Unity as a basis for this research. Our technology of choice has been the Kinect v2 as the Kinect v1 version did not allow for the tracking of as many joints as we needed.<br/>
The application allows one or two users to compete in a free throw basketball game over who can get more shots into the basket. The application works whether or not there is a second user.The players use their raised left hand to throw the basketball at the correct power level.

Game code sourced from : https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-basketball-free-throw-game-with-unity--cms-21203
and : https://github.com/tutsplus/BasketballFreeThrowUnity

Body Joints List : https://www.codeproject.com/articles/743862/kinect-for-windows-version-body-tracking <br/>
The UI has multiple elements to help the user:<br/>

* In the top left there is a camera output that shows what the Kinect can see. We have tried but couldn't get it to output the Skeleton or Joints of the current users.

* Top Middle – This is the basketball hoop that the players have to shoot at.

* Bottom left & right – The user scores are shown as digit values in both corners. They increase when the user gets a basket.

* Bottom middle – This is the outline of the basketball to imitate the baskebtall being held by the user.

* Bottom left & right of the basketball outline – These are the power bars. When they start moving the user knows that the Kinect is ready to shoot.


<a name=""installation""></a><b>Installation</b><br/>
To play the game you will need the Kinect V2 equipment for Windows as well as the Kinect SDK. You Will also need Unity.

#<a name=""details""></a><b>Project Details</b><br/>

There are three gestures in this application both of which imitate an actual throw in basketball:

* Closed fist – The user has to start the the game with the fist closed to imitate the holding of a basketball. This is also crucial for the shooting as the Kinect shoots as soon as the hand is opened.

* Arm raised above shoulder – In order for Kinect to allow the user to shoot, the users arm must be raised above his shoulder. The user can then Move his hand back and forth to adjust the power of the shot. The distance between the hand and shoulder joints is the force that is added to the ball.

* Open hand gesture – Once the user completes the predefined action of raising back the arm he has to shoot by opening the palm of his hand and swinging forward.

We have determined for these to be the most natural actions a person would take during a basketball throw. Apart from the closed fist which was a necessity these imitate the actions taken during a throw.

A dribbling gesture could also be implemented to allow for the bouncing of the ball from the ground (perhaps with possible sound feedback) but we didn't have enough time to implement it.

**TELEGRAM: @BasketballBettingBot**

The fourth Ball Brother didn't make it to the *NBA* and slipped off into sports
gambling and wants to play with you! He sends you 11 NBA games to bet on each week,
10 good ones and one battle between the supreme tank commanders.
The one who gets the most games right in a week gets one point.

You play against the other members of your group chat and the overall winner is
the one with the most points at the end of the season.
There's also an alternative ranking that's just looking at the total number of
bets you guys got right, and doesn't care about weekly wins if that's more
your style.

To get started add the bot (@BasketballBettingBot) to your group chat and 
send /start into the chat. Afterward you'll receive the games to bet on 
for the upcoming week. Each game is sent to you in the form of a poll, 
so just answer these to participate in the game. 
After sending /start for the first time, all you need to do is answer the polls
that will be sent to you weekly.
This continues until the NBA season ends or you end the season yourself (/stop_season).
The bot can't read your group chat's messages, just the ones starting with an '/',
so don't worry about trash talking him - he won't know. 

**These are the commands he understands:**

- **/start** -> Start your season! (wait until everyone who wants to participate was
added to the group)

- **/standings** -> Show standings for the ongoing week

- **/full_standings** -> Show standings for the whole season

- **/all_bets** -> Show fraction of correct bets for the whole season
(Alternative to weekly standings)

- **/week_standings** -> Show standings for a specified week

- **/sage** -> Cleanse the chat from toxic energy

- **/stop_season** -> End the betting season and receive final standings.
THIS CAN'T BE UNDONE!

Here's an example of what it looks like:

- Logistic regression
- SVM
- Multiple layer perceptron
- CNN

## Introduction

### Dataset

Our dataset is four basketball videos containing about 400, 000 frames.

### Annotation

Basically, we label each frame as goal(1) or not goal(0). A frame is labeled as goal if from the time when the bottom of the basketball touches the loop to the time when the top of the ball is leaving the nets. 

### Preprocess

Label, cut, and randomly shuffle the frames. See details in [preprocess](https://github.com/Yao-Shao/Basketball-Game-Goal-Detector/blob/master/preprocess/PrepareData.py).

### Feature extraction

For naive classifier, LR, SVM, we use [HoG](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1069007) to extract features.

### Evaluation

A ROC curve is used for evaluation.

Find basketball players with similar shot charts

# Examples

A live version of this flask app can be seen at: https://similar-shooter.herokuapp.com/.  Note, I am not paying anything to host this, so it could take forever to run...

Here are some static examples, though.

Who is most similar to **DeAndre Jordan**? Top shot-chart match: **Rody Gobert**
![Jordan](http://i.imgur.com/dB6cT2s.png?1)
![Gobert](http://i.imgur.com/Lt64djC.png?1)

Who is most similar to **Buddy Hield**? Top shot-chart match: **Tim Hardaway**
![Hield](http://i.imgur.com/yfHK0kL.png?1)
![Hardaway](http://i.imgur.com/BzG8mBI.png?1)

# How does it work?

I played around with a lot of different algorithms to define what makes shot charts similar.  It's an interesting question: **what does it mean for two shot charts to be similar?**

I made the following assumptions:
* If two shot charts are the exact same, but with different densities, they are still very similar.  Players with different usage rates shouldn't be penalized as being different.
* The most important features are distance from the hoop, and 2PT vs 3PT shots.  I largely disregard things like which side of the court players shoot from.

Using these assumptions, I compare the [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) of each players shot distributions.  Players with low KL divergence have high similarity.

# What data are used?

Shot data and shot charts are scrapped seperately (design flaw).  These data were scraped March 7 2017, so they contain data from the 2017 season up until this data.  

To get up-to-date data, rerun `scraper/scraper.py` and `shotchart/shotchart.py`.

To get historic data, change global parameter `YEAR` before scraping.

192,snestler/wncaahoopR,R,"# wncaahoopR <img src=""figures/wncaahoopR_hexsticker.png"" align=""right"" />
`wncaahoopR` is an R package for working with women's NCAA Basketball play-by-play (and other) data.

This package relies heavily on the work done by Luke Benz (lbenz730) in his package `ncaahoopR`, designed for working with men's NCAA basketball play-by-play data.

`wncaahoopR` also scrapes data from ESPN, but differs in that it does not have scraping provided in multiple functions, choosing to only scan in the data once and then makes use of that `pbp` object within R to produce win-probability and game flow charts, as well as assist networks.

`wncaahoopR` is a joint effort between Seth Berry (saberry) and Scott Nestler (snestler).  They welcome bug identification and ideas via the Issues tab, but please look at open issues before creating a new one.

## Installation
You can install `wncaahoopR` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages(""devtools"")
devtools::install_github(""snestler/wncaahoopR"")
```

## Functions
Several functions use ESPN game_ids. You can find the game_id in the URL for the game summary, as shown below in the URL for the summary of the Notre Dame - Michigan game played on Nov. 23, 2019.
![game_id](figures/espn.png)

### Scraping Data
* ```get_pbp_game(game_ids)```:  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of one or more ESPN game_ids.
* ```get_pbp_season(team, season)```: Game entire current season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team and season. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 
* ```get_roster(team, season)```: Get a particular team's roster, `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 
* ```get_game_ids(team, season)```: Get a vector of ESPN game_ids for all games in which ```team``` plays in. `season` defaults to current season, but can be specified in ""2019-20"" form. 

The `team` parameter in the above functions must be a valid team name from the `ids` dataset built into the package. See the __Datasets__ section below for more details.

### Win-Probability and Game-Flow Charts

__Win Probability Charts__

There is a function (```wp_chart```) for plotting win probability charts, using the ```ggplot2``` library. NOTE: This is equivalent to the  (```gg_wp_chart```) function in ncaahoopR package.  We did not see the need to maintain a base R graphics function.  

1. _NOTE 1:  For now, all win probability charts are ""naive,"" in that they do not incorporate a pre-game line or spread, until we determine a reliable and freely available source (since this is not provided on ESPN, like for the mens game)._  
2. _NOTE 2:  For now, the WP calculations are based on historical data from NCAA MBB games; this will be updated in a future release._

```wp_chart(pbp, home_col, away_col, show_legend = T)```

* ```pbp``` Play-by-play (pbp) object created from w_get_pbp_game function.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team; defaults to the primary color ine ncaa_colors. 
* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team; defaults to the primary color in ncaa_colors.
* ```show_gei```: Logical, whether or not to show Game Excitement Index on chart. Default = `TRUE`.

__Game Flow Charts__

```game_flow(pbp, home_col, away_col)```

* ```pbp``` Play-by-play (pbp) object created from w_get_pbp_game function.
* ```home_col``` Chart color for home team; defaults to the primary color ine ncaa_colors.
* ```away_col```: Chart color for away team; defaults to the primary color ine ncaa_colors.

__Game Excitement Index__

```game_exciment_index(pbp)```

Returns ```GEI``` (Game Excitement Index) for given ESPN game_id. For more information about how these win-probability charts are fit and how Game Excitement Index is calculated, check out the below links

* [Model Methodology](https://lukebenz.com/post/ncaahoopr_win_prob/ncaahoopr_win_prob/)
* [Game Excitement Index](https://lukebenz.com/post/gei/)

__Game Control Measures__

```average_win_prob(game_id)```

* ESPN game_id for which to compute time-based average win probability (from perspective of home team).

```average_score_diff(game_id)```

* ESPN game_id for which to compute time-based average score differential (from perspective of home team).


### Assist Networks

__Traditional Assist Networks__

```assist_net(pbp, team, node_col, three_weights, threshold, message = NA, listing = T)```

* ```team``` is the ESPN team name, as listed in the `ids` data frame.  Or can be 'home' or 'away' (without quotes).
* ```season```: Options include ""2018-19"" (for entire season), or a vector of ESPN game IDs. 
* ```node_col``` is the node color for the graph.
* ```three_weights``` (default = ```TRUE```): Logical. If TRUE, assisted three-point shots are given 1.5 weight. If FALSE, assisted three-point shots are given weight 1. In both cases, assisted two-point shots are given weight 1. 
* `threshold`: Number between 0-1 indicating minimum percentage of team assists/baskets a player needs to exceed to be included in network. Default = 0.
* ```message``` (default = ```NA```) Option for custom message to replace graph title when using a subset of the season (e.g. conference play).
* `listing`: Return list of assist network related statistics (default = `TRUE`)

__Circle Assist Networks and Player Highlighting__

```circle_assist_net(pbp, team, season, highlight_player, highlight_color, three_weights, message = NA, listing = T)```

* ```team``` is the ESPN team name, as listed in the `ids` data frame.    Or can be 'home' or 'away' (without quotes).
* ```season```: Options include ""2018-19"" (for entire season), or a vector of ESPN game IDs. 
* ```highlight_player```: Name of player to highlight in assist network. `NA` yields full team assist network with no player highlighting. Default = `NA`.
* ```highlight_color```: Color of player links to be highlighted. `NA` if ```highlight_player``` is `NA`.
* ```three_weights``` (default = ```TRUE```): Logical. If TRUE, assisted three-point shots are given 1.5 weight. If FALSE, assisted three-point shots are given weight 1. In both cases, assisted two-point shots are given weight 1. 
* `threshold`: Number between 0-1 indicating minimum percentage of team assists/baskets a player needs to exceed to be included in network. Default = 0.
* `message`: User supplied plot title to overwrite default plot title, if desired. Default = `NA`.
* `listing`: Return list of assist network related statistics (default = `TRUE`)

### Shot Charts
`wncaahoopR` does not currently include the ability to plot shot location data, as this information is not currently available on ESPN, like it is for some mens games.

* ```secs_remaining```: Time remaining in regulation, in seconds.
* ```secs_remaining_absolute```: The time remaining until the game is over, in seconds. For example a game that goes to overtime would begin with 2700 seconds remaining (2400 for regulation and 300 for overtime), and regulation would end with 300 seconds remaining.
* ```description```: A description of the play/game event.
* ```home_score```: Home team's score.

"
201,hqadeer/nba_scrape,Python,"# nba_scrape

An easy-to-use Python utility to scrape professional basketball data off stats.nba.com using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.

## Installation:

`pip install nba_scrape`

## Usage:

`from nba_scrape import NBA`

#### Example:

`>>> league = NBA()`

`>>> lebron = league.get_player('lebron james')`

`>>> lebron.get_stat('pts', '2016-17', playoffs=True)`

`>>> 32.8`

`>>> lebron.get_stats(['pts', 'reb', 'ast', 'ts%'], '2015-18', mode='playoffs')`

`>>> {'2015-16': (26.3, 9.5, 7.6, 0.585), '2016-17': (32.8, 9.1, 7.8, 0.649), '2017-18': (34, 9.1, 9, 0.619)}`

#### Get an instance of the NBA class:

`league = NBA()`

#### Get a player:

`player = league.get_player(player_name)`

OR

`player = league.get_player_by_id(id_number)`

#### Get a single stat:

`player.get_stat(stat_name, season)`

#### Get multiple stats (formatted as a dict with tuples as items):

`player.get_stats([stat1, stat2, stat3], season_range, mode=mode)`

(Possible modes are 'season', 'playoffs', or 'both'; 'season' is the default.)

## Current functionality:

1) Compile a list of all NBA players and their IDs when initializing the NBA class.

2) Easily load all regular season and playoff stats off a player's career page to a SQLite database. Only the player's name is required as input.

3) Retrieve all traditional stats and select advanced ones (such as True Shooting Percentage) via database queries; only the requested stats and seasons are required as input.

4) Browser-agnostic; uses the best available browser or raises an error if no supported browser is available.

5) Test suite to ensure correct statistics are returned.

# The DeepSportRadar Player Re-Identification Challenge

## ** The DeepSportRadar Challenges will come back next year (2023) with some improvements, stay tuned on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/JvMQgMkpkm)! **


Welcome to the DeepSportRadar Player Re-Identification Challenge, which is one of the [ACM MMSports 2022 Workshop](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/index.html) challenges. 
An opportunity to publish, as well as a $1000 prize by competing on [EvalAI](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1685/overview). 
See [this page](http://mmsports.multimedia-computing.de/mmsports2022/challenge.html) for more details.
In this challenge, participants will have to re-identify basketball players across multiple video frames captured from the same camera viewpoint at various time instants.
For that purpose, we provide our Synergy Re-Identification dataset with image crops of players, referees and coaches.
The dataset is split into a training, test and challenge set. 
Test and challenge sets are both split into queries and galleries, similar to traditional ReID datasets.
The testing-set should be used to evaluate your model, both on the public EvalAI leaderboard that provides the temporary ranking, and when communicating about your method.
The challenge-set will be used for the official challenge ranking.

If you use any DeepSportradar dataset in your research or wish to refer to the baseline results and discussion published in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08190), please use the following BibTeX entry:

**NOTE this code is based on Open-reid repo: https://github.com/Cysu/open-reid.git""**

_Open-ReID is a lightweight library of person re-identification for research
purpose. It aims to provide a uniform interface for different datasets, a full
set of models and evaluation metrics, as well as examples to reproduce (near)
state-of-the-art results._

We want to thank the authors for providing this tool. This version applies some changes to the original code to specifically adapt it to the DeepSportradar Challenge on Person Re-Identification. 

This challenge is a fork of the [player re-identification challenge](https://github.com/VIPriors/vipriors-challenges-toolkit/tree/master/re-identification) proposed in the [2nd VIPriors workshop challenges](https://vipriors.github.io/challenges/)

&nbsp;
<p align=""center""><img src=""assets/banner.png"" width=""740""></p>

## Installation

**Note that the file ```setup.py``` specifies the libraries version to use to run the code.**

Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/). 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DeepSportRadar/player-reidentification-challenge.git
cd player-reidentification-challenge
pip install -e .
```

## Example

Run the following command to train a baseline model:
```shell
python baseline/synergyreid_baseline.py -b 64 -j 2 -a resnet50 --logs-dir logs/synergy-reid/
```

## Data

Person re-identification data are provided by [Synergy Sports](ttps://synergysports.com). 
Data come from short sequences of basketball games, each sequence is composed by 20 frames. 
For the test and challenge sets, the query images are persons taken at the first frame, while the gallery images are identities taken from the 2nd to the last frame.

The idea behind the baseline is to provide a quick introduction to how to handle the re-id data. 
Specifically, attention should be put on the dataset creation and the dataloaders.
The data files are provided under ```baseline/data/synergyreid/raw/synergyreid_data.zip```.

The baseline code extracts the raw files in the same directory and prepares the splits to use for training, test and challenge.

Specifically the dataset is divided as:

```shell
SynergyReID dataset loaded
  subset      | # ids | # images
  ---------------------------
  train       |   436 |     8569
  query test   |    50 |       50
  gallery test |    50 |      910
  traintest    |   486 |     9529
  ---------------------------
  query challenge  |   468 |      468
  gallery challenge |  8703 |     8703
```

Train and test identities can be merged (to improve performance) using the flag ```--combine-traintest```.

The image filename is divided in three numbers: the first one is the person-id; the second one is the sequence where the image was taken; and the third one is the frame number.

The test-set is divided in query and gallery to match the challenge-set format. With the flag ```--evaluate``` the distance matrix for the test set is also saved.
The identities of the gallery are NOT provided; gallery ids are just random.

## Submission on EvalAI
Submit your result through the [challenge page on the EvalAI platform](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1689/overview).
You need to submit a _.csv_ file as the pairwise distance matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m is the number of query images and n is the number of gallery images. 
The first row and the first column are the query and gallery ids respectively.
Query ids have to be ordered. 
Please check the example provided in the baseline ```baseline/synergyreid_baseline.py``` with the 'write_mat_csv' function.

Please refer to the challenge webpage for complete rules, timelines and awards: [https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html](https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html).

203,gbrunner/Courtside-Geography,HTML,
204,HeroChan0330/Play-Video-With-Stm32,C,"# [正经向]如何使用STM32播放篮球视频  
## 第一步  
第一步当然是要先配置环境啦，opencv、KEIL都不会配怎么和大家一起打篮球  
<div align=""center""><img src =""img/1.jpg""/></div>

当然还要买硬件：一个Stm32F4（内存、flash没什么大的要求）、Stm32下载器、一块3.2英寸LCD屏幕(ILI9341)、一个micro sd(TF)卡。  
淘宝买到的Stm32F4开发板都是把一些常用接口和外设都设计好的，一般比较萌新友好(坑钱)的会配套显示屏一起卖，直接插上去就可以用的那种，SD卡槽一般也会有的。  
把显示屏的线接好(使用fsmc控制器)，大家如果没买那种配套设计的显示屏的话，接线就可能会像作者这么awesome了  
<div align=""center""><img src =""img/6.jpg""/></div>

## 第二步
首先我们要知道一张图片是像素点阵组成的，经过各种的编码压缩方式就变成了常说的jpg,png,gif。视频是由一帧帧图片组成的，也是有特定的编码压缩方式。想要解码视频运算量还是挺大的，通常使用硬件解码（硬解），在STM32里面挺难完成。所以我们要把视频中每一帧的图片拿出来，再用比较简单的编码方式写进文件，然后在STM32中读取。  
首先我们打开一个篮球视频  
```c++
VideoCapture cap(""CXK.mp4"");
```
我们做一个循环，每隔0.1秒读取一张图片
```c++
Mat frame;
int index=0;
while (cap.read(frame)){
    imshow(""cxk"",frame);
    index++;
    cap.set(CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC ,100 * index);
    waitKey(100);
}
```
这里cap.set(CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC ,100 * index);把视频的时间位置指向100 * index ms处  
什么，原视频的16:9，显示屏是4:3，比例不对？那我们进行一下裁剪  
```c++
void resize(Mat&img){
	resize(img,img,Size(426,240));
	img=img(Rect(53,0,320,240));
}
```
还有一点就是某宝买到的LCD屏幕都是16位rgb的，我们屏幕上面显示的真彩色是24位的，所以还要进行转换。  
```c++
cvtColor(frame,frame_16bits,COLOR_BGR2BGR565);
```
然后再按照行->列的读取顺序把每一帧的图片信息写进文件，再把文件放进SD卡

## 第三步
什么，没有声音？没有鸡你太美的篮球视频是没有灵魂的——鲁迅。  
<div align=""center""><img src =""img/2.jpg""/></div>  

其实音频文件里面的数据，是一连串的模拟值，经过压缩编码后变成了mp3什么的。我们用最简单的编码方式(PCM)的文件，将数据读出来，将图片和音频整合在文件中，就能同步播放视频和图片啦！！！  
首先一个wav文件的文件头是这样的。
```c++
__attribute__((packed)) struct WavHead{
	int8_t RIFF[4];
	int32_t filesize;
	int8_t WAVE[4];
	int8_t FMT[4];

	int32_t size1;
	int16_t fmttag;//1
	int16_t channel;//1
	int32_t samplespersec;//每秒采样数
	int32_t bytepersec;
	int16_t blockalign;
	int16_t bitpersamples;
	int8_t DATA[4];
	int32_t datasize;
};
```
什么看不懂？别管那么多，我们要的是datasize和samplespersec（这里的音频文件为了方便处理，通过软件转成了16位深，16000hz采样率（即256kbps)，单声道）。datasize即后面的数据的总字节数量，samplespersec即采样率。  
然后只需要在每一帧的循环里面，写入音频的数据：每0.1s采样1600个16位值，即3200字节。写入图像数据：320 * 240 * 2个字节。  
这样我们就完成了视频文件的预处理啦！！！  
<div align=""center""><img width = '300' height ='300' src =""img/3.gif""/></div>

## 第四步
终于来到最重要的一步了，什么不会Stm32？会抄就行了。
<div align=""center""><img src =""img/4.jpg""/></div>

首先我们先拿到一份卖家提供的非常完善的示例代码，里面以及包含了各种基本功能的实现，我们需要的是LCD屏幕、SD卡读写部分的示例代码。  
什么卖家没给你示例代码？在这里我教大家一个找硬件文档的万能方法：淘宝。将你手上的电子器件型号输入淘宝，随意点进一个卖家，在商品介绍一般都有很显眼的某度网盘的链接，懂了吧？  
我们将lcd屏幕初始化，usart初始化，sd卡初始化等一系列看不懂的初始化放在一起。然后我们需要知道的有这么几个。  
1、SD卡文件读取，卖家给的实例代码一般会封装好的，sd卡初始化之后的操作就和我们在windows下写的控制台(就是那个黑窗)的文件读写操作时一样的。  
2、在lcd屏幕显示图片，这个商家也封装好的，调用个函数，传进去显示图片的位置，还有储存图片像素的数组就能显示图片。  
3、定时器、时钟、dac，这是用来同步播放音乐的，我们把音频数据从文件读入之后，通过中断把音频文件通过dac播放。因为单片机是没有负电压得，所以使用2个dac输出，产生电压差。  
那么显示一帧图片的时序是这样的：  
开启一个计时器计数->从文件读入3200byte(16000hz / 10 * 2)的音频数据->定时器中断函数发现音频数据长度大于0，之后的中断开始循环输出音频数据，输出完将音频数据长度置0->从文件读完音频数据后同时读图片数据，显示在显示屏中->通过计时器判断这一帧图片的显示时间是否满100ms，然后开始下一帧的显示。  
代码量挺多的就不贴上来了，文章最后会放出全部代码的github链接，反正，我们只是代码的搬运工。  
搞完上面的代码后我们就能很清晰地播放篮球视频，但是发现声音不对劲，太小了。dac的驱动是3.3v，学过简单的电路就知道，下面是一个肥肠简单的信号放大电路。  
<div align=""center""><img src =""img/5.jpg""/></div>

如果想要输入电压3.3v，输出电压5v，那么1.7R1=3.3R2  
那么随缘R1=2kΩ R2=1kΩ吧
使用运放的话输出电流还是挺小的，作者手上暂时只有一个蜂鸣器，全损音质，几乎听不出那句熟悉的鸡你太美，不过这个思路应该是对的，这个电流应该是可以驱动一个耳机（应该还要加个滤波电容，这得结合耳机阻抗）。如果想要实现广场舞那种震撼感，自行实现放大电路吧。  
最后，献上视频（声音是另外录后期加上去的）：

### A better implementation in Python with added features and a working API is now available on : [Nba-Match-Predictor](https://github.com/treelover28/NBA-match-predictor). The new version is still a project-in-progress 

**Version**: 2

**Author:** Khai H Lai

**Last Updated:** 9/3/2019

**Changelog:** 
* Added hashCode() and equals() to class Team.
* Added webscraping functionality using JSoup library

**Language:** Java
![NBA Finals 2019](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50902696/64215334-f46c7e80-ce4f-11e9-9d50-25ddd49c66da.jpg)
This simple program uses Monte Carlo simulation to:
 * predict the result of an NBA match.
 * output each team's probability of winning the matchup.

Has **basic UI** that allows users to type in the names of the teams they wish to simulate the match-up with.

### Procedure Description
The simulator uses library Jsoup to scrape data from Basketball Reference NBA 2019 Ranking and Team Rankings. It then uses Monte-Carlo simulation (with added random statistical variations applied on the procedure described on Basketball Distribution) to give the probability of each team winning the match-up.

### Next update
* Make this program into a webapp that can be easily used and accessed by the public.
* Make this program into a browser extension that automatically fetch from that day's NBA schedule and output predictions.
* Goal for completion: December 20, 2019

207,fuzzthink/basketball-public,R,"The shell script ""demo.sh"" loads scraped data alias tables
between the two data sets (NCAA and Basketball Reference)
for schools and players. It then runs sample R code that does
a simple stepwise regression to detect some NCAA features
that impact NBA playing time 1 year out from the draft.

You won't be able to run these without installing PostgreSQL,
R etc., but I've included two text files showing the results. The
first is ""shell_output.txt"" which shows the output of the ""demo.sh""
script (including the total time take - about 12 seconds).

The file ""feature_selection.txt"" shows the results of the stepwise
regression.

This is the final model - no surprise, the pick number dominates
in a non-linear way. Also settled on were height, position, games,
assists per game and steals per game. I did not examine any
interaction terms, nor did I look at other measures of NBA value,
but these are straightforward given the database (up to the
limitations of my scraped data, of course).

I haven't adjusted college performance for NCAA strength of
schedule yet.
