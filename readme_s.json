Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection. We can get the result by simply uploading files to the web App, or submitting a POST request to the API. Please check the features below. There are more features coming up! Feel free to follow.\nAll the data for the shooting pose analysis is calculated by implementing OpenPose. Please note that this is an implementation only for noncommercial research use only. Please read the LICENSE, which is exaclty same as the CMU's OpenPose License.\nIf your are interested in the concept of human pose estimation, I have written a research paper summary of OpenPose. Check it out!\nGetting Started\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.\nGet a copy\nGet a copy of this project by simply running the git clone command.\ngit clone https://github.com/chonyy/AI-basketball-analysis.git\n\nPrerequisites\nBefore running the project, we have to install all the dependencies from requirements.txt\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nPlease note that you need a GPU with proper CUDA setup to run the video analysis, since a CUDA device is required to run OpenPose.\nHosting\nLast, get the project hosted on your local machine with a single command.\npython app.py\n\n\n\nAlternatives\nGoogle Colab\n\nThanks to hardik0. Now we can play around with it without a GPU machine!\nHeroku\nThis project is also hosted on Heroku. However, the heavy computation of TensorFlow may cause Timeout error and crash the app (especially for video analysis). Therefore, hosting the project on your local machine is more preferable.\nPlease note that the shooting pose analysis won't be running on the Heroku hosted website, since a CUDA device is required to run OpenPose.\nProject Structure\n\n\n\nFeatures\nThis project has three main features, shot analysis, shot detection, detection API.\nShot and Pose analysis\nShot counting\n\n\n\nCounting shooting attempts and missing, scoring shots from the input video.\nDetection keypoints in different colors have different meanings listed below:\n\nBlue: Detected basketball in normal status\nPurple: Undetermined shot\nGreen: Shot went in\nRed: Miss\n\nPose analysis\n\n\n\nImplementing OpenPose to calculate the angle of elbow and knee during shooting.\n\n\n\nRelease angle and release time are calculated by all the data collected from shot analysis and pose analysis. Please note that there will be a relatively big error for the release time since it was calculated as the total time when the ball is in hand.\nShot detection\n\n\n\nDetection will be shown on the image. The confidence and the coordinate of the detection will be listed below.\nDetection API\n\n\n\nGet the JSON response by submitting a POST request to (./detection_json) with \"image\" as KEY and input image as VALUE.\nDetection model\n\n\n\nThe object detection model is trained with the Faster R-CNN model architecture, which includes pretrained weight on COCO dataset. Taking the configuration from the model architecture and train it on my own dataset.\nFuture plans\n\n Change the model to a more efficient YOLOv4\n Implement SORT Tracking algorithm to filter out false detection\n Improve the visual effect\n Improve the efficiency, making it executable on web app services.\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt":

nba\nNOTES:\nBLACKLISTED IP ADDRESSES:\nIt appears as though the NBA has blacklisted certain blocks of IP addresses, specifically those of cloud hosting providers including AWS. As such, you may hit a situation where an application using this package works fine on your local machine, but doesn't work at all when deployed to a cloud server. Annoyingly, requests from these IPs seem to just hang. More information here and here -- the second issue has a curl command somewhere which will quickly tell you if NBA is accepting requests from your IP. (Incidentally, this is also the same reason the TravisCI build is always \"broken\" but tests all pass locally). There is a simple pass-through server in scripts/proxy that can be used to get around this restriction; you can put the proxy server somewhere that can reach NBA.com (e.g. not on AWS or Heroku or similar) and host your actual application on a cloud provider.\nCORS restrictions on browser usage\nThis package can't be used directly from the browser because of CORS restrictions imposed by nba.com. If you run some sort of intermediate server which relays requests to NBA.com, you can change the host the client points to by following the instructions in the Transport Layer section\nNBA API\nThe stats.nba.com uses a large number of undocumented JSON endpoints to provide the statistics tables and charts displayed on that website. This library provides a JavaScript client for interacting with many of those API endpoints.\nGetting Started\nNBA.findPlayer(str) will return an object with a player's name, their ID, and their team information. This method is built into the package.\nAll methods in the NBA.stats namespace require an object to be passed in as a parameter. The keys to the object are in the docs for the stats namespace here\nconst NBA = require(\"nba\");\nconst curry = NBA.findPlayer('Stephen Curry');\nconsole.log(curry);\n/* logs the following:\n{\n  firstName: 'Stephen',\n  lastName: 'Curry',\n  playerId: 201939,\n  teamId: 1610612744,\n  fullName: 'Stephen Curry',\n  downcaseName: 'stephen curry'\n}\n*/\nNBA.stats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: curry.playerId }).then(console.log);\nFor more example API calls, see /test/integration/stats.js and other test files.\nStability Warning\nThis is a client for an unstable and undocumented API. While I try to follow semver for changes to the JavaScript API this library exposes, the underlying HTTP API can (and has) changed without warning. In particular, the NBA has repeatedly deprecated endpoints, or added certain required headers without which requests will fail. Further, this library comes bundled with a (relatively) up-to-date list of current NBA players which is subject to change at any time -- the specific contents of it should not be considered part of this library's API contract.\nUsability\nTo put it nicely, the NBA's API endpoints are a little clunky to work with. This library tries to strike a balance between being usable but not making assumptions about how the data will be used. Specifically, the NBA sends data in a concise \"table\" form where the column headers come first then each result is an array of values that need to be matched with the proper header. This library does a simple transformation to zip the header and values arrays into a header-keyed object. Beyond that, it tries to not do too much. This is important to note because sometimes the various \"result sets\" that come back on a single endpoint seem sort of arbitrary. The underlying HTTP API doesn't seem to follow standard REST practices; rather it seems the endpoints are tied directly to the data needed by specific tables and charts displayed on stats.nba.com. This is what I mean by \"clunky\" to work with -- it can be tricky to assemble the data you need for a specific analysis from the various endpoints available.\nDocumentation\nstill lots to do here...\nThere are four primary parts of this library\n\nTop-level methods\nstats namespace \u2014 docs\nsynergy namespace see tests\n\u2013 data namespace see tests\n~sportVu namespace~ NBA has removed sportVu endpoints. the methods exist here for backwards compatibility but they throw errors\n\nTransport Layer\nIn some cases you will want to use a different transport layer to handle HTTP requests. Perhaps you have an HTTP client library you like better than what I used here. Better yet, you want to get stats for the WNBA or the G League. The following code snippet shows how to use the withTransport method to create a new client with your own transport function.\n// here we are getting stats for the WNBA!\n\nconst nba = require(\"nba\");\nconst getJSON = require(\"nba/src/get-json\");\n\n// for the G League, try \"stats.gleague.nba.com\"\nconst newHost = \"stats.wnba.com\";\n\nconst transport = (url, params, options) => {\n  // simply swap the host and then defer the rest to the built in getJSON function\n  const fixedURL = url.replace(\"stats.nba.com\", \"stats.wnba.com\");\n  return getJSON(fixedURL, params, options);\n};\n\n// create a new stats client here with our WNBA transport\nconst wnbaStats = nba.stats.withTransport(transport);\n\n(async () => {\n  const result = await wnbaStats.playerInfo({ PlayerID: \"1628886\" });\n  console.log(result);\n})();\n\"I don't use Node.js\"\nPlease take a look at nba-client-template. The relevant part of the repo is a single JSON document from which many programming languages can dynamically generate an API client. The repo contains (sloppy) examples in Ruby and Python. Compiled languages can use code generation techniques to the same effect -- there's a (again, sloppy) example in Go. If you'd like me to publish it to a specific registry so you can install it with your language's package manager, please open an issue. Please note, however, that package only includes  the endpoints exposed by this library under the stats namespace -- sportvu and synergy endpoints aren't yet included in it. I also plan to add a command-line interface to this library so that it can be easily driven as a child process by another program.\n\n\n\n", "language": "JavaScript"}, {"readme_txt":

Please\nsee LICENSE.md for details.\nDevelopment Info\nIf you just want to play the game, go to https://zengm.com/. Instructions\nbelow are for developers who want to run a copy locally so they can make changes\nto the code.\nIf you want to contribute but get stuck somewhere, please contact me! I'm happy\nto help.\nLicense and Contributor License Agreement\nThis project is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please\nsee LICENSE.md for details.\nIf you want to contribute code to this project, you must sign a contributor\nlicense agreement. There are separate forms for individuals and entities (such\nas corporations):\n\nIndividual CLA (this is probably what you want)\nEntity CLA\n\nMake a copy of the form, fill in your information at the bottom, and send an\nemail to jeremy@zengm.com with the subject line, \"Contributor License Agreement\nfrom YOUR_NAME_HERE (GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE)\".\nStep 1 - Installing\nMake sure you're using a recent version of Node.js, older\nversions probably won't work. Then, all of the tooling used in development can\nbe set up by simply installing Yarn 1 and\nrunning:\nyarn install\n\nfrom within this folder.\nStep 2 - Building\nTo build the app along with all its assets, run\nyarn run build\n\nHowever during development, you probably would rather do\nyarn run start-watch\n\nwhich will start the server and watch JS and CSS files for changes and\nrecompile. This simply runs both yarn run start and yarn run watch together,\nwhich alternatively can be run separately if you wish.\nBy default this will build the basketball version of the game. For other sports,\nset the SPORT environment variable to \"football\", \"baseball\", or \"hockey\", like:\nSPORT=football yarn run start-watch\n\nOpen package.json to see all available development scripts.\nStep 3 - Running\nTo run the game locally, you need some way of running a web server to display\nthe content. There are currently two ways to do it. It doesn't matter which you\nuse as long as you can get it to run on your computer.\n1. Node.js (easiest)\nRun\nyarn run start\n\nand point your browser to http://localhost:3000/. If you use the command yarn run start-watch from above, then running the command yarn run start is not\nnecessary.\n2. Apache\nThe mod_rewrite rules in .htaccess let the game run in Apache. Everything\nshould work if you point it at the build folder with mod_rewrite enabled.\nStep 4 - Testing\nTypeScript and ESLint are used to enforce some coding standards. To run them on\nthe entire codebase, run\nyarn run lint\n\nIntegration and unit tests spread out through the codebase in *.test.ts files.\nCoverage is not great. They can be run from the command line with\nyarn test\n\nThere is also a single end-to-end test which creates a league and simulates a\nseason. To execute the end-to-end test, run\nyarn run test-e2e\n\nFor the end-to-end test, by default it is basketball. If you want it to do\nfootball, stick SPORT=football  in front.\nCode Overview\nThis is a single-page app that runs almost entirely client-side by storing data\nin IndexedDB. The core of the game runs inside a Shared Worker (or a Web Worker\nin crappy browsers that don't support Shared Workers), and then each open tab\nruns only UI code that talks to the worker. The UI code is in the src/ui\nfolder and the core game code is in the src/worker folder. They communicate\nthrough the toUI and toWorker functions.\nThe UI is built with React and Bootstrap.\nIn the worker, data is ultimately stored in IndexedDB, but for performance and\ncross-browser compatibility reasons, a cache (implemented in\nsrc/worker/db/Cache.ts) sits on top of the database containing all commonly\naccessed data. The idea is that IndexedDB should only be accessed for uncommon\nsituations, like viewing stats from past seasons. For simulating games and\nviewing current data, only the cache should be necessary.\nThe cache is overly complicated because (1) the values it returns are mutable,\nso you better not mess with them accidentally, and (2) when you do purposely\nmutate a value (like updating a player's stats), you need to remember to always\nwrite it back to the cache manually by calling idb.cache.*.put.\nIn both the worker and UI processes, there is a global variable self.bbgm\nwhich gives you access to many of the internal functions of the game from\nwithin your browser.\nShared Worker Debugging\nAs mentioned above, the core of a game runs in a Shared Worker. This makes\ndebugging a little tricky. For instance, in Chrome, if you console.log\nsomething inside the Shared Worker, you won't see it in the normal JS console.\nInstead, you need to go to chrome://inspect/#workers and click \"Inspect\" under\nhttp://localhost/gen/worker.js.\nIn any browser, if you have two tabs open and you reload one of them, the worker\nprocess will not reload. So make sure you close all tabs except one before\nreloading if you want to see changes in the worker.\nService Worker\nThis only applies if you use Apache, not if you use yarn run start!\nA service worker is used for offline caching. This can make development tricky,\nbecause if you load the game in your browser, make a change, wait for\nbuild/watch to finish, and then reload... you will not see your change because\nit will cache the original version and then not update it on a reload. This is\nthe normal behavior for service workers (they only switch to a new version when\nyou actually close the website and reopen it, not on a reload), but it makes\ndevelopment annoying.\nTo work around that, in Chrome you can use the \"Update on reload\" option\nand keep your devtools open. Then reloading will always get you the latest\nversion.\nEven with that, ctrl+shift+r may be a good idea to make sure you're seeing your\nlatest changes.\nGit Workflow\nIf you want to contribute changes back to the project, first create a fork on\nGitHub.

Here's below an image from the mobile app\npropotype based on the platform.\n\nTable of content\n\nData collection\n\nDecomposition - Data Design Decisions\nWeb Scraping - Selenium/Beautiful Soup\n\n\nPredictions\n\nData Preprocessing\nAlgorithm Tuning and Running\n\n\nResults Presentation\n\nBookmakers comparaison over the year\nModel Performance Metrics\nML one-sport process in a nutshell\n\n\nLicense\nLinks\nNotes\n\nData collection\nData Design Decisions\n\n\nIt is decided that the two participating teams/players in each matchup are respectively represented by visitor team and home team (player A/player B in case of Tennis).\nThis is contrary to another popular method of representing the teams as the favorite and underdog.\n\n\nThe point differential is chosen to be positive when the home team scores more points than the away team.\n\n\nTo represent the difference between the two teams that are playing in the matchup, the ratio or the difference between\nthe same attributes are taken between the two teams. That is, the home team\u2019s statistic is divided by the visitor team\u2019s\nstatistic. Therefore, when attributes are a positive indicator of performance, a value greater than 1 indicates that\nthe home team performs better for that particular attribute. When the attributes are integers (not statistics), then\nthe difference between the home team\u2019s attribute and the away team\u2019s attribute is taken. Examples of this are win\nstreak, compared to statistics such as points per game that would be compared by taking the ratio.\n\n\nWeb Scraping\nThe data is scraped from several websites according to each sport using Python and the Selenium and BeautifulSoup (only for MLB data)\npackages for Python. Data sources for each sports are described in the \"Link\" section.\nAccording to each sport/league, the script goes through each summary season page and writes season team stats and season game stats\n(e.g. date, the home team, away team, home team points, away team points etc.) to a csv file.\nGame stat data, team stat data, and datetime data are merge later into a feature file (.npz) for the ML algorithm (Lasso Logistic Regression)\nHere's below an example team stats data and game stats data for the NFL league.\nIn the same scripts, After having obtained the raw data set, data is cleaned throughout the script. The script\nchecked the completeness and validity of all the data files, and eliminated any CSV parsing errors\nor erroneous data values.\nex of NFL team stat data from the 2000 season to the 2015 season\n\nex of NFL game stat data from the 2000 season to the 2015 season\n\nPredictions\nData preprocessing\nData preprocessing is made in the Prepare_for_ML.py file. Here is the main idea:\nHaving validated all our available data, the script then proceeded to load the data from the csv files\ninto an SQL database using the SQLite single-file database engine and a few Python scripts. The\nflexibility of SQL queries allowed one to easily perform complex joins and merges between multiple\ntables via the the script.\nInstead of using each team\u2019s attribute independently in the analysis, attributes are formed to represent the difference\nbetween the attribute for the two participating teams in the matchup. For example, in the NBA league the attributes\n\u2018average_blocks_per_game_home\u2019 and \u2018average_blocks_per_game_away\u2019 are not used in the analysis, rather,\nthe ratio between the two values is used.\nThus, the script converts the clean scraped data to data structures that the libraries in scikit-learn can easily use.\nThe ultimate result of the routines included in this file is a numpy array containing all the features and game results\nfor the historical game data. The structure 'features.npz' contains this output and is eventually loaded by scikit-learn.\nThe features have not been normalized but the next script provide one the ability to easily normalize or standardize the data.\nAlgorithm Tuning and Running\nThis step is located in the \"RunModelLeague.py\"\nAccording to each sport, it uses scikit-learn and historical game results (in the .npz file) to make predictions on the current season games\nthat have not been played.\nA logistic regression predictive model with the L1 penalty is created. Analysis of results are output to csv files.\nHere is below an example of the output for the 2017 nba season\n\nThen, webscraping (through the ScrapeMatchupDatetimeOddsTwoChoicesLeague.py file) is performed  through the betbrain's website so as one can have more information on each league upcoming match.\nThus, the final output give additionnal detail such as odds for both home and away teams, the choice of the bookmaker\n(e.g. the team with the lowest odd if designed to be the bookmaker choice), the choice of the algorithm (Sibyl), if\nthere is a divergence or no between Sibyl and the bookmaker ('Y' = yea, 'N' = no).\nHere's below an example of the final output for the Ligue 1 soccer league.\n\nResults Presentation\nModel Performance Metrics\nFirst of all, webscraping (through the SibylVsBookiesNFL.py file) is performed in order to have sufficient data to make comparison with\nbookmakers over the year (oddsportal's website).\nBelow you can see an example of output that help one make a clear performance comparison between Sibyl and the bookies\nfor the 2016 MLB season.\n\nThen, algorithm performance measure is performed through the ModelMetricsLeague.py file\nThe script provides one for a given league data such as algorithm accuracy (e.g. % of correct predictions) up-to-date, the team of the month to\nbet on (team which has performed well when chosen by the algorithm), the worst team of the month, The top teams to bet on\nbased on the divergence stategy etc...\nML one-sport process in a nutshell\nFor a given league, the entire process described above can be run via the ModelLeague.py file.\nHere is an example of the process code for the\n# coding: utf-8\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\n\nclass ModelNHL(object):\n    from RunModelNHL import NHLMakePredictions\n    from ScrapeMatchupDatetimeOddsTwoChoicesNHL import AcquireMatchupDatetimeOddsTwoChoices\n    from SibylVsBookiesNHL import AcquireSibylVsBookiesNHL\n    from ModelMetricsNHL import ModelMetricsNHL\n\n    def __init__(self, current_season, feature_file, nhl_db_name,\n                 betbrain_upcoming_games_url, cs_team_stats_filename, league_name, upcoming_games_output_filename_us,\n                 upcoming_games_output_filename_eu, oddsportal_url_fix, oddsportal_url_list_format):\n        self.current_season = current_season\n        self.feature_file = feature_file\n        self.data = np.load(feature_file)\n        self.tableau_input_filename = \"nhl_tableau_output_\" + str(current_season) + \".csv\"\n        self.current_season = current_season\n        self.X = self.data['X']\n        self.y = self.data['y']\n        self.nhl_db_name = nhl_db_name\n        self.betbrain_upcoming_games_url = betbrain_upcoming_games_url\n        self.cs_team_stats_filename = cs_team_stats_filename\n        self.league_name = league_name\n        self.upcoming_game_outputs_filename_us = upcoming_games_output_filename_us\n        self.upcoming_games_output_filename_eu = upcoming_games_output_filename_eu\n        self.oddsportal_url_fix = oddsportal_url_fix\n        self.oddsportal_url_list_format = oddsportal_url_list_format\n        self.cs_team_stats_filename = cs_team_stats_filename\n        self.season_over = 'No'\n\n    def __call__(self):\n        print \"NHL Machine Learning process execution...\"\n        x = self.NHLMakePredictions(self.current_season, self.feature_file, self.nhl_db_name)\n        x()\n        print \"NHL Machine Learning process execution...OK\\n\"\n\n        print \"NHL Scraping odds and datetime from Betbrain.com process execution...\"\n        w = self.AcquireMatchupDatetimeOddsTwoChoices(\n            self.season_over,\n            self.betbrain_upcoming_games_url,\n            self.cs_team_stats_filename, self.league_name,\n            self.tableau_input_filename,\n            self.upcoming_game_outputs_filename_us,\n            self.upcoming_games_output_filename_eu)\n        w()\n        print \"NHL Scraping odds and datetime from Betbrain.com process execution...OK\\n\"\n\n        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        self.season_over = w.season_over\n        print self.league_name + ' season is over?

This capstone project was conducted and approved by a reviewer as part of Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. See the final report here for details.\nNote that the code was updated since the writing of the report and the content does not necessarily match up. This project is under minor refactoring and documentation as of Jun 2019, feel free to reach out to me via email at kengo@hey.com.\nWhat We'll Do\nThe end goal of this project is to generate a series of lineups for a fantasy basketball website DraftKings. To achieve that, we'll scrape player statististics from each regular season game starting in the 2014-15 season as well as past fantasy salary information. First, we'll build a predictive model for player performance, and then we will use genetic algorithm to construct fantasy lineups to maximize the total fantasy points while satisfying the salary constraint.\nWhat We Won't Do\nGiven the complexity of the series structure and difference in nature, we won't be considering playoff games. In addition, a major factor omitted from our analysis is the opponent's defensive ability as a team or at a given position (for instance, Paul George is excellent at stealing the ball), which arguably is one of the most important factors of the game. Tackling this aspect will be an easy improvement to this project.\nRequirements\nAlong with libraries specified in requirements.txt, you need to sign up with Plotly for free to create interactive visualizations.\nUnderstanding Fantasy Sports\nThe key to select a good fantasy lineup is to identify players that are consistent performers. This basic intuition comes from Harry Morkowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), and the following scatter plot looks at the relationship between risk and return, where return is the average fantasy points over a given range of games (in this case, past 10 games) and risk is its standard deviation. For a given level of risk (x-axis), a player with a better return is considered to be superior. The plot is based on the late 2018-19 season statistics, where, for instance, Lebron James is shown in the top-left with a 10-game average of a whopping 58.1 fantasy points and a 7.4 standard deviation. The top curve starting from Harden (top right), Lebron, Paul George, Gorbert, Sexton, and Zubac can be considered as Efficient Frontier in the framework of the MPT. In general, players on the outer left of the cluster are considered as good assets with low risk and high return. Players are color-coded based on rough positions of PG, SG, F (SF, PF, SF/PF), and C (PF/C, C). A fully interactive version can be accessed here.\n\nAnother important dimension of the game of fantasy basketball is player salary. Fantasy sports websites like DraftKings determine player salary values given their previous performance and roster information in a semi-automatic fashion, such that it is more costly to include \"stud\" players with high expected return (LeBron, Westbrook, Harden) into your lineup. DraftKings has a salary cap of $50,000 for a selection of 8 players, giving each player an average salary of $6250. The graph below shows a scatterplot of a player's salary and his actual performance of the day in the latest games of the 2018-19 season. One striking insight is that while it is easy to identify studs like Westbrook who had a total fantasy poitns of 61.5 for his 11.8k salary April 10, \"value\" players who exceed expectations are much more difficult to find, with a large variance given a salary level. For instance, Jamal Crawford on the top left had monstrous performance for a combined fantasy points of 70.25, despite the low expectation of his $4300 salary. These \"value\" players are what differentiates winning lineups from those of a typical beginner with a collection of star players and underachieving benchwarmers. This requires deeper insight into who will outperform their expectations. For instance, an injury of a starting player most likely increases minutes for other starting members and the second option player on the bench. A fully interactive version can be accessed here.\n\nProject Structure\nThis project consists of 9 Jupyter notebooks and functionalities are described below, where the second half consists of construcing machine leanring models and making inference, and optimising lineups for DraftKings.\n\n\n01.data_scraping.ipynb scrapes games data from Basketball-Reference.com and salary and position information from RotoGuru.\n\n\n02.merging_data.ipynb merges the two datasets with name standardisation and preliminary preprocessing of data such as calculation of FPTS based on the key statistics.\n\n\n03.exploratory_analysis.ipynb visually explores relationships between; salary and actual FPTS and; expected FPTS and standard deviation of the past 10 games.\n\n\n04.feature_engineering.ipynb constructs the baseline model with simple average along with additional three datasets with weighted average, where several features are engineered and incorporated.\n\n\n05.baseline_models.ipynb sets up the baseline model with simple season average adopted by DraftKings and linear regression with feature selection models. For notebooks 06-08, we use 5-fold cross validation to approximate model errors.\n\n\n06.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb uses bayesian optimisation method to find the best parameters for a boosting model using lightGBM. Parameters and their results are saved in a text file.\n\n\n07.neural_networks.ipynb constructs three neural network models using keras, and saves model weights only when there was an improvement. While deep learning models might not suit this dataset of limited size, it shows improvement compared to boosting models.\n\n\n\n08.predictions.ipynb trains on the whole dataset except for the month of March 2019, where each contest's cashline for double up was manually obtained from RotoGrinders. Inference is made on this test data from March 2019.\n\n\n09.lightgbm_bayesian_optimization.ipynb uses Genetic Algorithms to select best combinations of players on a given set of games ans predictions. Performance of the lineups chosen by the algorithm against other DraftKings users is examined for contests held in March, 2019. Note that the contest data is manually obtained from Rotogrindrs' ResultsDB page without scraping. Predictions from the baseline model and final model are compared to the actual performance. The following figure shows the optimal lineup this model returns, with differences between the actual FPTS and predicted FPTS with neural network and baseline models.\n\n\n\nMain procedures are coded and explained in markdown using Jupyter Notebook. Although not requred, jupyter nbextentions are highly recommended for convenience and visibility (see link). Useful extensions are Codefolding, ExecuteTime, Collapsible Headings, and Variable Inspector. http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbasketball_reference_scraper\nInstalling\nVia pip\nVia GitHub\nWait, don't scrapers like this already exist?\nAPI\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nbasketball_reference_scraper\nBasketball Reference is a great resource to aggregate statistics on NBA teams, seasons, players, and games.

All dependencies for this project ship with either the Python 3 standard library or the everyday machine/deep learning toolkit (TensorFlow, keras, scikit-learn). To read videos from disk, I use scikit-video io module, which you may need to install.

However, I didn't have access to labelled data for non-field goal events (like rebounds, free throws, players running down the court, Javale doing dumb shit, etc). As a result, these examples use 90-frame (at 8 fps, so about 11 seconds long) videos of field-goal make/miss events - the only kind the model can currently identify.\nSince all data used for training and testing was from the 2017-18 season, I picked out several plays from this video of the last 5 minutes of Spurs/Rockets Game 5 in the 2017 playoffs to see how accurately plays from a completely different season are classified:\n \n \n \n \nIncorrect classification examples:\n...because, like most things in life, this isn't perfect:\nThis Danny Green and-one is best classified as an INSIDE_MAKE, but MIDRANGE_MAKE is not a terribly bad guess:\n \nThe following play is an offensive foul followed by a MIDRANGE_MISS, but is classified as more likely to be an INSIDE_MAKE (51%) than a MIDRANGE_MISS (27%):\n \nSometimes, the classifier flat-out fails confidently \ud83d\ude1e :\n \n \nNote that some of these plays are quite difficult to judge properly at this resolution and frame rate, without sound. Now imagine that these videos are also black and white, and that is the kind of data that this model has been trained on. Therefore, it's unsurprising that it isn't very good, but working with higher quality videos requires significantly more computational resources \ud83d\udcb0.\nFAQ\nI'll fill this out if and when people ask questions.\nReddit discussion\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nncaahoopR \nInstallation\nFunctions\nScraping Data\nWin-Probability and Game-Flow Charts\nAssist Networks\nShot Charts\nDatasets\nExamples\nWin Probability Charts\nGame Flow Chart\nSingle-Game Assist Network\nSeason-Long Assist Network\nCircle Assist Networks\nPlayer Highlighting\nShot Charts\nGlossary\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nncaahoopR \nncaahoopR is an R package for working with NCAA Basketball Play-by-Play Data. It scrapes play-by-play data and returns it to the user in a tidy format, allowing the user to explore the data with assist networks, shot charts, and in-game win-probability charts.\nFor pre-scraped schedules, rosters, box scores, and play-by-play data, check out the ncaahoopR_data repository.\nTo see the lastest changes in version 1.5, view the change log here.\nInstallation\nYou can install ncaahoopR from GitHub with:\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"lbenz730/ncaahoopR\")\nIf you encounter installation issues, the following tips have helped a few users successfully install the package:\n\nIf given the option to compile any packages from source rather than installing existing binaries, choose 'No'.\nWindows users with trouble installing the package should try running the following command before reinstalling the package: Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = \"true\")\nWindows users with trouble installing devtools should try first installing the backports package via install.packages(\"backports\").\n\nFunctions\nSeveral functions use ESPN game_ids. You can find the game_id in the URL for the game summary,\nas shown in the URL for the summary of the UMBC-Virginia game below.\n\nScraping Data\n\n\nget_pbp(team, season): Get entire current season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team and season. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n\n\nget_pbp_game(game_ids, extra_parse):  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of ESPN game_ids. extra_parse is a logical whether to link shot variables and attempt possesion parsing. Default =   TRUE.\n\n\nget_roster(team, season): Get a particular team's roster. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n\n\nget_schedule(team, season): Get a team's schedule. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n\n\nget_game_ids(team, season): Get a vector of ESPN game_ids for all games involving team specified. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n\n\nget_master_schedule(date): Get schedule of all games for given date. Use YYYY-MM-DD date formatting.\n\n\nget_boxscore(game_id): Returns list of 2 data frames, one with each teams' box score for the game in question. Written by Jared Andrews.\n\n\nseason_boxscore(team, season = current_season, aggregate = 'average'): Returns (aggregated) player stats over the course of a season for a given team.\n* team: team to return player stats for.\n* season: of form YYYY-YY. Defaults to current season.\n* aggregate: one of 'average' (per-game average statistics), 'total' (sums of season stats) or 'raw' (just return all box scores binded together). 'average' is the default. Contributed in collaboration with Kurt Wirth\n\n\nThe team parameter in the above functions must be a valid team name from the ids dataset built into the package. See the Datasets section below for more details.\nWin-Probability and Game-Flow Charts\nWin Probability Charts\nThe latest function for plotting win probability charts is wp_chart_new. Following the 2021-22 season other win probability chart functions will be deprecated and replaced by this function (it will be renamed to wp_chart but I don't want to break any existing pipelines during the season). It no longer requires users to input colors. For best results consider saving via ggsave(filename, height = 9/1.2, width = 16/1.2) (or some other 16/9 aspect ratio.)\nwp_chart_new(game_id, home_col = NULL, away_col = NULL, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)\n\ngame_id ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\nhome_col Chart color for home team (if NULL will default to ncaa_colors primary_color field).\naway_col: Chart color for away team (if NULL will default to ncaa_colors primary_color field).\ninclude_spread: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations. Default = TRUE.\nshow_legend: Logical, whether or not to show legend/text on chart. Default = TRUE.\n\nA prior version of wp_chart used base R while gg_wp_chart used the ggplot2 plotting library. As of the 2020-21 season, both functions call the same ggplot2 library, and gg_wp_chart now simply aliases wp_chart\nwp_chart(game_id, home_col, away_col, include_spread = T, show_legend = T)\n\ngame_id ESPN game_id for the desired contest.\nhome_col Chart color for home team.\naway_col: Chart color for away team.\ninclude_spread: Logical, whether to include pre-game spread in Win Probability calculations.

These functions are written by Meyappan Subbaiah.\nget_shot_locs(game_id): Returns data frame with shot location data when available. Note that if the extra_parse flag in get_pbp_game is set to TRUE, shot location data will already be included in the play-by-play data (if available).\n\ngame_id: ESPN game_id from which shot locations should be scraped.\n\ngame_shot_chart(game_id, heatmap = F): Plots shots for a given game.\n\ngame_id: ESPN game_id from which shot locations should be scraped.\nheatmap (default = FALSE): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.\nshot-plotting colors derived from team's primary color listed in ncaa_colors data frame.\n\nteam_shot_chart(game_ids, team, heatmap = F): Plots shots taken by team during a given set of game(s).\n\ngame_ids: Vector of ESPN game_ids from which shot locations should be scraped.\nteam: Which team to chart shots for.\nheatmap (default = FALSE): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.\nshot-plotting colors derived from team's primary color listed in ncaa_colors data frame.\n\nopp_shot_chart(game_ids, team, heatmap = F): Plots shots against a team during a given set of game(s).\n\ngame_ids: Vector of ESPN game_ids from which shot locations should be scraped.\nteam: Which team to chart opponents' shots for.\nheatmap (default = FALSE): Logical, whether to use density-heat map or plot individual points.\n\nDatasets\ndict A data frame for converting between team names from various sites.\n\nNCAA: the name of the team, as listed on the NCAA website\nESPN: the name of the team, as listed in ESPN URLs\nESPN_PBP: the name of the team, as listed in the ESPN Play-By-Play logs\nWarren_Nolan: the name of the team, as listed on WarrenNolan.com\nTrank: the name of the team, as listed on barttorvik.com\nname_247: the name of the team, as listed on 247Sports.com\n\nids A data frame for converting between team names from various sites.\n\nteam: the name of the team to be supplied to functions in ncaahoopR package\nid: team id; used in ESPN URLs\nlink: link; used in ESPN URLs\n\nncaa_colors A data frame of team color hex codes, pulled from teamcolorcodes.com.

For example a game that goes to overtime would begin with 2700 seconds remaining (2400 for regulation and 300 for overtime), and regulation would end with 300 seconds remaining.\ndescription: A description of the play/game event.\nhome_score: Home team's score.\naway_score: Away team's score.\nscore_diff: Score differential from the home team's perspective (home_score - away_score)\nplay_length: Duration of the the given play, in seconds.\nwin_prob: Win probability for the home team.\nnaive_win_prob: Win probability for the home team not factoring in pre-game point spread. Useful for computation of win probability added (WPA).\nhome_timeout_remaining: Number of timeouts remaining for the home team.\naway_timeout_remaining: Number of timeouts remaining for the away team.\nhome_favored_by: Number of points by which the home team is favored, prior to tip-off. If Vegas point spread is available on ESPN, that is used as the default. When not available, an attempt is made to impute the pre-game point spread from derived team strengths. Imputed point spreads are not available for games prior to the 2016-17 season or when one of the teams is not in Division 1.\ntotal_line: Total Vegas over/under for the game, where available.\nreferees Referees for the game.\narena_location: City in which the game was played.\narena: Name of arena where game was played.\ncapacity: Capacity of arena where game was played.\nattendance: Attendance of game, where available.\nwrong_time: An attempt to label play-by-play events tagged at the wrong time. These are filtered out of all graphical and statistical helper functions, but may still be useful for certain analyses where time of event is of less importance.\n\nIf extra_parse = TRUE in get_pbp_game, the following variables are also included.\n\nshot_x: The half-court x coordinate of shot.\nshot_y: The half-court y coordinate of shot. (0,0) represents the bottom left corner and (50, 47) represents the top right corner (from persepective of standing under hoop).\nshot_team: Name of team taking shot.\nshot_outcome: Whether the shot was made or missed.\nshooter: Name of player taking shot.\nassist: Name of player asssisting shot (assisted shots only)\nthree_pt: Logical, if shot is 3-point field goal attempt.\nfree_throw: Logical, if shot is free throw attempt.\n\n\nStand-alone shot location data frames contain the following variables.\n\nteam_name: Name of shooting team.\nshot_text: Description of shot.\ncolor: Color hexcode used to render shot chart graphic on ESPN.\ndate: Date of game\noutcome: Whether the shot was made or missed\nshooter: Player attempting the shot\nassister: Playing assisting the shot\nthree_pt: Logical, whether the shot is a 3-point attempt\nx: x-coordinate of shot location\ny: y-coordinate of shot location\n\nThe court is 50 feet by 94 feet, with (0,0) always being placed in the bottom left corner of the shot chart. Any full-court shot chart rendered using game_shot_chart() preserves ESPN shot locations as they are found online, while halfcourt charts using team_shot_chart() convert all shot locations to to a 50 feet by 47 feet halfcourt. The perspective on the halfcourt shot charts is as if one is standing under the hoop, looking toward the opposition hoop. (0,0) again represents the bottom left corner and (50, 47) represents the top right corner.\n\n\n", "language": "R"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLSTM with MDN for basketball trajectories\nTo create a model\nThe files\n\n\n\n\n\nreadme.md\n\n\n\n\nLSTM with MDN for basketball trajectories\nThis is the code repository for our paper, Applying Deep Learning to Basketball Trajectories.

execute SPARQL queries against these files is to use RDF4J Server, Workbench, and Console. RDF4J Server and its GUI, RDF Workbench, are both web applications that run in an application server like Tomcat.\nStep 1: Download RDF4J\nDownload and extract the latest RDF4J SDK. It will contain a bin folder with the console binary, and a war folder with the rdf4j-server.war and rdf4j-workbench.war web applications.\nStep 2: Install Apache Tomcat\nThis usually just involves downloading and extracting the Tomcat binaries, editing libexec/conf/tomcat-users.xml to add a user with tomcat and manager-gui permissions, and executing catalina run to start the server.\nStep 3: Open the Apache Tomcat App Manager (http://localhost:8080/manager/html) and deploy the web applications\nUse the app manager GUI to deploy the rdf4j-server.war and rdf4j-workbench.war web applications to your Tomcat installations.\nStep 4: Use the RDF4J console to create a database\nCreate a Native database with spoc,sopc,opsc,ospc,posc, and psoc indexes. This will take disk space for the indexes, but will make your queries run much faster.\n$ cd eclipse-rdf4j-2.3.2/bin/\n$ ./console.sh -s http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server \nConnected to http://localhost:8080/rdf4j-server\nRDF4J Console 2.3.2+496af9c\n\n2.3.2+496af9c\nType 'help' for help.\n> create native-rdfs\nPlease specify values for the following variables:\nRepository ID [native]: pbprdf-database\nRepository title [Native store with RDF Schema inferencing]: PBPRDF Database\nQuery Iteration Cache size [10000]: \nTriple indexes [spoc,posc]: spoc,sopc,opsc,ospc,posc,psoc\nEvaluationStrategyFactory [org.eclipse.rdf4j.query.algebra.evaluation.impl.StrictEvaluationStrategyFactory]: \nRepository created\n> open pbprdf-database\nOpened repository 'pbprdf-database'\npbprdf-database> \n\nStep 5: Import your Turtle file\nYou can use the instructions above to import your *.ttl or *.ttl.zip files into your newly created database. You can either use the RDF4J console or RDF4J workbench GUI to execute SPARQL queries.\nBuilding pbprdf\nPrerequisite: sbt 1.x and Java 8 or later must be in your path\n\nInstalling SBT\nInstall sbt 1.x on Mac\nInstall sbt 1.x on Unix\nInstall sbt 1.x on Windows\n\nMac or Unix:\n$ git clone https://github.com/andrewstellman/pbprdf.git\n$ cd pbprdf\n$ sbt assembly\n$ ./pbprdf\n\nWindows:\nC:\\Users\\Public\\src>git clone https://github.com/andrewstellman/pbprdf.git\nC:\\Users\\Public\\src>cd pbprdf\nC:\\Users\\Public\\src\\pbprdf>sbt assembly\nC:\\Users\\Public\\src\\pbprdf>pbprdf\n\n(The above commands use sbt-assembly to create a fat JAR.)\nOther useful build commands\nCompile the code and run the unit tests:\n$ sbt compile test\n\nGenerate Eclipse project files (via sbteclipse:\n$ sbt eclipse\n\nGenerate sample Turtle from the unit test data and print it to the console\nusing the script:\n$ ./pbprdf src/test/resources/com/stellmangreene/pbprdf/test/htmldata/\n\nvia SBT:\n$ sbt \"run src/test/resources/com/stellmangreene/pbprdf/test/htmldata/\"\n\n\n\n", "language": "HTML"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nMarch-Madness-2017\nKaggle Competition for Predicting NCAA Basketball Tourney Games.

Currently it only supports hexbin shot charts, with lots of flexibility, but is alpha quality and will be refactored to support other binning mechanisms and other mark types on top of a basketball court.\nCurrently customizable:\n\nCourt dimensions/lines\nBinning definition\nHexagon size range and color range\nIntegrating different shot chart datasets\nTitles and labels\n\nSetup\n\nInclude d3.js\nInclude hexbin.js d3.hexbin - NOTE: this is a fork\nInclude d3.chart.js - d3.chart\nInclude d3.chart.defaults.js d3.chart.defaults\nInclude d3.basketball-shot-chart.js\nInclude d3.basketball-shot-chart.css (or include the sass file)\n\nExamples\nThis library is currently used to generate the shot charts at tothemean, and there's a blog post that walks through using this chart.\nIf you clone the repo, you'll also find a simple example in the example directory.\nTo use:\nGenerally, you likely have some shot chart data that's an array of data points representing shots, including the x, y position on the court, and whether the shot was made:\n  var data = [{\"x\":2,\"y\":9,\"made\":1},{\"x\":2,\"y\":8,\"made\":1},...];\n\nYou can continue with this, or you can also self aggregate to reduce the size/complexity of the data, and capture number of makes and attempts at a location:\n  var data = [{\"x\":2,\"y\":9,\"made\":3,\"attempts\":3},{\"x\":2,\"y\":8,\"made\":0,\"attempts\":4},...];\n\nNOTE: Even in this scheme, a point for the same location can be repeated, as all points will be aggregated as part of the binning process (which is how we handle the first simple case).\nOnce we have our data, we can quickly chart it:\n  var chart = d3.select(el)\n    .append(\"svg\")\n    .chart(\"BasketballShotChart\")\n      .draw(data); \nBy default, the shot chart visualization recognizes the data structure above, but that can easily be configured with the options below. Also, by default, the heat chart is based on a range of shooting 0% to 100%. Most shot charts you've probably seen compare to the average, and its up to you to calculate that, but you can use the options below to update the range of values for the heatMap, and to make the hexagon colors or radiuses based on any value from your data you want.\nOptions\nYou can pass any of these options when creating a new chart. You can change them through public setters, but the shot chart won't autoimically pick them up - yet.\nThese are all defined in the code, and I recommend looking there for more information on how they're actually utilized.\n\nbasketDiameter: basketball hoop diameter (ft) (default: 1.5)\nbasketProtrusionLength: distance from baseline to backboard (ft) (default: 4)\nbasketWidth: backboard width (ft) (default: 6)\ncolorLegendTitle: title of hexagon color legend (default: 'Efficiency')\ncolorLegendStartLabel: label for starting of hexagon color range (default: '< avg')\ncolorLegendEndLabel: label for ending of hexagon color range (default: '> avg')\ncourtLength: full length of basketball court (ft) (default: 94)\ncourtWidth: full width of basketball court (ft) (default: 50)\nfreeThrowLineLength: distance from baseline to free throw line (ft) (default: 19)\nfreeThrowCircleRadius: radius of free throw line circle (ft) (default: 6)\nheatScale: d3 scale for hexagon colors (default: d3 quantize scale if [0, 1] domain and colors from Goldsberry's shot charts)\nheight: height of svg, specifying won't change scale of chart (default: undefined)\nhexagonBin: method of aggregating points into a bin (e.g. function (point, bin) {...}) (default: bins by aggregating makes and attempts from points)\nhexagonBinVisibleThreshold: how many points does a bin need to be visualized (default: 1)\nhexagonFillValue: method to determine value to be used with specified heatScale (e.g. function (bin) {...}) (default: returns bin.made/bin.attempts)\nhexagonRadius: bin size with regards to courth width/height (ft) (default: .75)\nhexagonRadiusSizes: discrete hexagon size values that radius value is mapped to, intentionally hides low frequency points (default: [0, .4, .6, .75])\nhexagonRadiusThreshold: how many points in a bin to consider it while building radius scale (default: 2)\nhexagonRadiusValue: method to determine radius value to be used in radius scale (e.g. function (bin) {...}) (default: returns bin.attempts)\nkeyMarkWidth: width of key marks (dashes on side of the paint) (ft) (default: .5)\nkeyWidth: width the key (paint) (ft) (default: 16)\nrestrictedCircleRadius: radius of restricted circle (ft) (default: 4)\nsizeLegendTitle: title of hexagon size legend (default: 'Frequency')\nsizeLegendSmallLabel: label of start of hexagon size legend (default: 'low')\nsizeLegendLargeLabel: label of end of hexagon size legend (default: 'high')\nthreePointCutoffLength: distance from baseline where three point line because circular (ft) (default: 14)\nthreePointRadius: distance of three point line from basket (ft) (default: 23.75)\nthreePointSideRadius: distance of corner three point line from basket (ft) (default: 22)\ntitle: title of chart (default: 'Shot chart')\ntranslateX: method to determine x position of a bin on the court (default: x value)\ntranslateY: method to determine y position of a bin on the court (default: flips y axis to opposite side of court)\nwidth: width of svg (default: 500)\n\n\n\n", "language": "HTML"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Basketball Games Video Editor\n0.

This\npackage primarily revolves around the use of schedule, roster, and play-by-play data via stats.ncaa.com, and\nadditionally has features to calculate lineups, on/off results, and player game and multi-game statistics.\nInstallation\nFirst install the package devtools if you haven't already\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"jflancer/bigballR\")\nFunctionality\nRetrieving Game IDs and Other Information\nManually, game ids can be found in the url when browsing games, for example:\n4674164 is the game id for https://stats.ncaa.org/game/play_by_play/4674164\n\nget_date_games data frame with game info and game ids for a given date.\nget_team_schedule data frame with game info and ids for a given team.\nget_team_roster data frame with player roster information for a given team.\n\nGame Scraping Functions\n\nscrape_game the base function, given a game id will return a cleaned play by play file.\nget_play_by_play builds off of scrape_game, allows for compiling from multiple game ids formatted in a vector.\n\nData Manipulation Functions\n\nget_lineups given play-by-play data retrieved from game scraping functions, will calculate a variety of stats for all lineups.\non_off_generator calculate on/off statistics for specified players given lineup data from get_lineups().\nget_player_stats calculate a variety of player stats from play-by-play data at either a game or multi-game level.\nget_player_lineups acts as an easy way to filter lineup data, specifying players to exclude/include from the lineups.\n\nDatasets\n\nteamids dataset includes stats.ncaa team name, team conference, season, and team id for 17-18 and 18-19 seasons\n\nUse\nThere are many different progressions and ways to use this package. As an example, here are some natural steps you could take.\n# Get team schedule\n# Note: if you don't know the proper team.name (case sensitive), you can look it up in data(\"teamids\")\nschedule <- get_team_schedule(season = \"2018-19\", team.name = \"Duke\")\n# Get play by play for all games played so far in season\nplay_by_play <- get_play_by_play(schedule$Game_ID)\n# Generate all lineups and stats from the play by play\nlineups <- get_lineups(play_by_play_data = play_by_play, keep.dirty = T, garbage.filter = F)\n# Look at Zion Williamson's on/off statistics with lineups that include Reddish and Barrett\nzion_comparison <- on_off_generator(\"ZION.WILLIAMSON\", lineups, Included = c(\"CAM.REDDISH\",\"RJ.BARRETT\"))\nscrape_game / get_play_by_play\nFunctions to retrieve play by play data. scrape_game() works for individual games while get_play_by_play can handle a vector of gameids and will aggregate into a single dataframe. Warns users of potential errors and mistakes made by the game trackers. The number of player discrepancies warning counts displays the number of events players committed when it is found they were not on the court at the time of the event. The substitution mistake warning indicates an unclean substitution was entered. (ex. 2 players enter and 1 leaves)\n\ngame_id | string made up of digits given to each unique game. This can be found in the play-by-play url for each game.\ngame_ids | same function as above, but can handle character vectors of any length.\n\nget_date_games\nThis function returns a schedule for the given date and specified conference. Results are included if applicable, as well as the play-by-play game id\n\ndate | a character object containing a date in the format mm/dd/yyyy. Defaults is previous day (yesterday)\nconference | the common name used for a conference, not sensitive to case, spacing, punctuation, etc.\nconference.ID | alternatively, if the conference ID is known it replace the conference name variable.\n\nget_team_schedule\nThis function returns a data frame of the schedule for the specified team. This will include game ids used for play-by-play scraping if the game has ended, along with the team scores and attendance. Note: currently, the season/team.name parameters can only be used for the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 seasons.\n\nteam.id | The unique id given to each college/team for each season. This can be found in the url of the team page.\nseason | Season following format yyy1-y2, ex \"2018=19\"\nteam.name | Alternative to using the id, you can use a team name. This follows the format found in data(ids).\n\nget_team_roster\nThis function returns a data frame of the roster for the specified team. This will include player names and positions as well as jersey number, height and school year. Note: currently, the season/team.name parameters can only be used for the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 seasons.\n\nThis takes the same parameters and conditions as get_team_schedule() above\n\nget_lineups\nThis function takes in a play-by-play dataframe, and generates all possible lineups for both teams. It then calculates a variety of statistics/metrics at a lineup level.\n\nplay_by_play_data | play-by-play data from the functions scrape_game() or get_play_by_play()\nkeep.dirty | logical to specify whether or not to filter out potentially inaccurrate data. When FALSE, will remove all rows from games where the number of discrepencies is above the desired count.\ngarbage.filter | logical variable to specify whether or not to filter out garbage time entries.\nerror.thresh | lets user set their preferred discrepancy threshold with the keep.dirty variable. This means when less than the threshold occurs in a game, it will be considered clean. As defined in scrape_game(), a discrepancy occurs when a player registers an event when they are not found to be on the court.\n\non_off_generator\nThis function passes in lineup data and calculates the on/off lineup statistics for all lineup combinations of players specified. This allows users to view on/off statistics for individual players, as well as combinations of multiple players. Users can also specify if they'd like specific players to be included or excluded from all lineups in use\n\nPlayers | players desired to be compared with on/off\nLineup_Data | lineups collected from the get_lineups() function\nIncluded These Players will be on the court for every lineup considered.\nExcluded These players will be off the court for every lineup considered.\n\nget_player_lineups\nThis function finds all lineups from a given lineup data source that include/exclude certain players. It acts as a quick way to filter lineups for players.\n\nTakes same parameters as on_off_generator() with exception to the Players parameter\n\nget_player_stats\nThis function calculates many player stats for either individual games or aggregate to get multi-game stats.\n\nTakes all parameters described in get_lineups() function\nmulti.games | When false stats will be calculated on a game level. When true all games will be aggregated.\n\n\n\n", "language": "R"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsports.py\nInstallation\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsports.py\nGather live up-to-date sports scores.

Please note that ARKit is only capable wih\ndevices which use A9, A10, A11 chips and the devices that use these chips are:\na) iPhone 6s and 6s Plus\nb) iPhone 7 and 7 Plus\nc) iPhone SE\nd) iPad Pro (9.7, 10.5 or 12.9) \u2013 both first-gen and 2nd-gen\ne) iPad (2017)\nf) iPhone 8 and 8 Plus\ng) iPhone X\nNow coming to the project, it shows how to build a basic BasketBall app using ARKit. Taking it step by step:\nPS: Please note that we have to choose Augmented Reality App as template when you create the project.\n\nCamera Permission:\n\nThis step involves asking for permission from user for his Camera access. This can be done by adding 'Privacy - Camera Usage Description : This application will use the camera for Augmented Reality' as key-value in pair in info.plist\n\nAdding the hoop:\n\nAfter you launch the app, you just see the world infront of you through phone's camera. Now you can augment a Basketball hoop by just adding the code below:\nfunc addBackboard(){\n        guard  let backboardScene = SCNScene(named:\"art.scnassets/hoop.scn\") else{return}\n        guard let backboardNode = backboardScene.rootNode.childNode(withName: \"backboard\", recursively: false) else{return}\n        backboardNode.position = SCNVector3(x:0.0, y:0.5, z:-3)\n        \n        let physicsShape = SCNPhysicsShape(node: backboardNode, options: [SCNPhysicsShape.Option.type : SCNPhysicsShape.ShapeType.concavePolyhedron])\n        let physicsBody = SCNPhysicsBody(type: .static, shape: physicsShape)\n        backboardNode.physicsBody = physicsBody\n        \n        sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(backboardNode)\n        currentNode = backboardNode\n    }\n\n\nThen we add a Tap Gesture onto the SceneView to aim the ball at the basket.\nfunc registerTapGestureRecogniser(){\n        let tap = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap(gesture:)))\n        sceneView.addGestureRecognizer(tap)\n    }\n    \n    @objc func handleTap(gesture:UIRotationGestureRecognizer){\n        //scene view to be accessed\n        //access the center point of the sceneview\n        guard let sceneView = gesture.view as?

So, let's get to it.\n\nIn terms of its simplicity to implement, the model turned out to be decent. It predicted the right winner of each matchup that occurred in this tournament with an accuracy of about 78%, which isn't too bad. Better still, it was able to predict the correct winner of the entire tournament - the Virginia Cavaliers. This indicates that it did, to an extend, understand what was important in winning - in the case of Virginia, it seemed to be great defense and solid three-point shooting (which is probably why the model didn't even predict pre-tournament favourites Duke to make the finals).\nThe main flaw that I saw in the model was the fact that it did not take seedings into account. While the seeding would be the basis for most people's predictions in fixtures, as there tends to be a relatively strong correlation between the higher seed and the winning team, my model did not consider the seeding of the two teams in a matchup. This resulted in the model often making extremely risky predictions that were purely stats-based - I believe that the imposition of the seedings of the two teams will reduce the number of these risky predictions. The reason why it was difficult to incorporate seedings into the model was that the large majority of training data was from regular NCAA matches rather than the March Madness Championships. The large majority of teams playing in these NCAA matches, however, do not ever get assigned a seed - this is because they do not qualify for the Championships  itself. To get around this issue, I plan to utilize seedings in future predictive models with one slight tweak - I would assign a seeding of 16, which is the lowest possible seed in the Championships, to all teams that do not end up ever getting a seed. This indicates that they would be the weakest in the pool of teams if they qualified the Championships, which is valid given that they did not even make it.\nAnother shortcoming of the model, in my eyes, was that it didn't consider any of the previous matchups between the two teams considered. Head-to-head is usually a pretty good indicative of which team will win, since it is derived from experience. Adding this in future editions shouldn't be too difficult - it'll just require a data point that represents the yearly matchup details between two teams.\nThe project largely focused on the data side of the model, so little time was spent on optimizing the model - only a GridSearch was applied for the neural network. Optimization is, however, a clear distinguishing factor between average and great models. In order to improve on this next year, I would have to spend more time reading about about the latest advancements in the domain, and apply techniques that generate improvements which optimize the model. This may, however, require the implementation of techniques from new research papers.\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball-Detector\nhttps://youtu.be/3UeoKxw8UYs\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball\n\nBasketball\nA remake of Facebook Messenger's basketball game!

Indeed, the performance of the team can be further optimized by studying the behaviour of players under certain conditions, thus NBA teams already created highly skilled data science departments to handle tons of information, such as tracking data or the output of other advanced computer vision algorithms. However, European teams are far behind in this field, and tracking data is completely otherworldly for the 97% of them, but the worst thing is that there is not an existing culture-data tradition, which creates the need for data. Coaches have a solid point when they say that their job includes not only practice preparation, but also video sessions, individual meetings, or even physical and conditioning stuff, so they have basically no time to start digging for data for a rough analysis a posteriori.\nThe goal of BueStats is fulfilling these couple of gaps:\n\nProvide coaches with a basic tool that automatically extracts advanced-statistics reports.\nHelp coaches understand and handle data in order to create a natural habit. Reports' data will not have complex information, but game conditioning factors and metrics that are easy to understand (tutorials are coming soon!), as it is important to establish a solid numerical basis before moving forward.\n\nIn particular, at the moment, BueStats can provide advanced statistics reports of FEB teams (Spanish Basketball Federation), which include any team/player from:\n\nLiga Femenina Endesa (1st female Spanish division)\nLeb Oro (2nd male Spanish division)\nLiga Femenina 2 (2nd female Spanish division)\nLeb Plata (3rd male Spanish division)\nLiga EBA (4th male Spanish division)\n\nBueStats is a non-lucrative Python-based project out of the scope of my PhD, and it has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04, MacOS 10.15.2 and Windows 10. I really hope you like it!\n1. Requirements\n1.a. ChromeDriver\nBueStats does not only compute advanced basketball metrics, but it is also a web scraper that gets information from the HTML code of FEB websites (in a cool and legal way, of course). However, FEB's website is not that easy to scrap, given that there are dropdown menus that have to be changed, but these actions do not modify the general website link; for this reason, a remote browser controller has to be installed: Chromedriver. It is vital to install a Chromedriver version that matches your Google Chrome browser version, which can be find in Settings, and clicking About Chrome. Once installed, make sure that the downloaded chromedriver exectuable file is placed in the main BueStats folder.\n1.b. Python Dependencies\nAs exepected, some Open-Source Python libraries have to be installed as well for a proper running of this program. This dependencies are included in Requirements.txt in case you want to build a virutal environment; otherwise, these libraries can be easily installed with pip:\npip3 install numpy\npip3 install selenium\npip3 install lxml\npip3 install pandas\npip3 install requests\npip3 install bs4\n\n2. Interface\nBueStats has a simple straight-forward interface (Stats_GUI) as seen in the following screenshot:\n\n\n1. Team / Equipo: target team you want to scout or analyze. The name of the team must be a single unique word with no spaces belonging the the team original name; this is, the name of the team according to FEB. In the given example, Melilla's data will be extracted; note that Melilla is a unique team name, whereas \"Baloncesto\" or \"Club\" would not be.\n2. Season / Temporada: season you want to scout; in this case, 2018 indicates the 2018-2019 season (2019 would indicate 2019-2020 and so on).\n3. Division / Categoria: FEB division of the corresponding team. In order to unify groups and names, and bearing in mind that the program is case-sensitive, the following nomenclature has to be followed:\n\n3.a. Liga Femenina Endesa can be written as Endesa or LF.\n3.b. Leb Oro has to be written as ORO.\n3.c. Liga Femenina 2 has to be written as LF2, but given that there are 2 groups (A or B), the group must be included in the encoding after a comma: for example, LF2,A belongs to a team compeiting in the group A of Liga Femenina 2.\n3.d. Leb Plata is by far the most complex one, as it has two competition phases: the first one is geographically defined (Este / Oeste), while the second one depends on the previous results (A2). For this reason, a basic encoding has to be followed: PLATA,F1,F2 , where F1 belongs to the first phase and can be ESTE or OESTE, and F2 belongs to the second one and can be expressed as A1 and A2. An example could be: PLATA,ESTE,A1, or PLATA,OESTE,A2. However, if you want to output data just from one phase, you should encode it as: PLATA,F, where F could be one of the mentioned options (ESTE / OESTE / A1 / A2).\n3.e. Liga EBA has to be written as EBA, but as happened with Liga Femenina 2, the name of the group has to be included as well after a comma with either one or two characters: for instance, if the team plays in group C, which has division CA and division CB, the encoding would be EBA,CA or EBA,CB, but if the team plays in division B, which has no subdivisions, the encoding would be EBA,B.\n\n\n4. First Round / Primera Jornada is the first (included) round to be taken into account while extracting data.\n5. Last Round / \u00daltima Jornada is the last (included) round to be taken into account while extracting data.\n6. Top Teams / Equipos Top (optional) can be filled with the top teams of the competition, which might help to see how players perform against powerful teams. The set of teams has to be included with commas and no spaces.\n7. Bottom Teams / Equipos Cola (optional) can be filled with the bottom teams of the competition. It has to be mentioned that both Top and Bottom Teams might be filled with any set of teams as well (all sizes).\n8. Intervals / Intervalos will pack the performance of players/team in groups of N games, being N the number written in Intervals text box. For instance, if we split in groups of 5 the performance of a team that has played 13 games, statistics are separated for the 1-5, 5-10, and 10-13 games.\n9. Players / Jugadores (optional) can be filled with a set of players that you want to scout by writting unique surnames. For example, both Josep Franch De Pablo and Felipe Dos Anjos De Paula play in Melilla; if we write FRANCH in the text box, only stats from Josep Franch will be extracted, whereas if we write DE, the performance of both players will be analyzed (De Pablo / De Paula). Again, more than one player can be added: (i.e) FRANCH, AGADA.\nExtract All Rounds / Extraer Todas las Jornadas is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts the stats of the analyzed players for every single game in the given season.\nExtract Team Stats / Extraer Estad\u00edsticas de Equipo is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts statistics not only at a player-level but also at a team-level.\nExtract Rankings / Extraer Rankings is a checkbox that (when checked) extracts sorted rankings of the given team for each particular stat. This checkbox is related with the Textbox of Minimum Games / Minimo Partidos (optional), which can be set in order to set a threshold to include (or not to include) players in the rankings according to the games they have played; if the box is empty, this threshold is automatically set to half the number of games.\nConfiguration Folder / Carpeta Configuraci\u00f3n (optional) will be explained in Section 4 (Configuration Files).\nOutput Folder / Carpeta Destino is the path where the output files will be stored. By default, it is a folder called \"Reports\" in the same \"BueStats\" main folder (you might create it for simplicity).\nChange Language / Cambiar Idioma switches languages between Spanish and English; not only the interface will be affected, but also the output result.\nLoad Configuration / Cargar Configuraci\u00f3n will be also explained in Section 4 (Configuration Files).\n\nFinally...\nExtract Statistics / Extraer Estad\u00edsticas is the main button to start gathering data from FEB. Once you press this button, you just have to be a little patient; Chromedriver will keep popping up and closing FEB sites automatically while extracting information. Don't interact with these windows, but you can keep using your computer as usual.\nScouting the whole league!\nA \"hidden\" feature of BueStats (useful for scouts) is that not only teams and players can be analyzed, but also the entire league! For doing so, you just have to change the text in team for LIGA (in the given example, Melilla should be substituted by LIGA). Again, the names of players can be filtered as well. Please note that it might take a while to generate the outputs since there's much more information.\n3. Output\nBueStats produces quite a bunch of outputs in a .csv format, don't be overwhelmed because of that! The main reason for generating different statistic files is that the criteria to handle data changes among coaches and analysts, so there is not a best nor established way to do it! For a better visualization of the results, I would strongly suggest to mix the output files as you desire in a Google Spreadsheet file (by importing data), using different sheets and fixing the first row and the first two columns.  \n\nAll those files starting with a letter p belong to Player stats, whilst files starting with letters t and r correspond to Team and Ranking files.\n\nThe files that does NOT end with Phases.csv or Rounds.csv contain all player/team stats depending on several game-conditioning factors, such as Home / Away, Won / Lost, Initial-5 / Bench, Easy / Tough, Last3 games, and even the performance of the player against the desired teams included in Top/Bottom teams.\nThe files that end with Phases.csv contain the player/team stats clustered into the N-game groups indicated in the above-mentioned intervals.\nThe files that end with Rounds.csv contain the performance of the player/team in each round of the season.\nRankings (file that starts with r) includes the sorting of players from better to worst. \n\nApart from the game conditioning factors, the following advanced statistics are included: \n\nPlayer Level: playerAST%. eFG%, TS%, GScored, Possessions, Floor Percentage, Points per Shot, %REB, %DRB, %ORB, STL%, Touches, Versatility, Usage, Win Scores, OER, DER, Net Points.\nTeam Level: Pace, OER, DER, eFG%, TS%,Play%, FTR%, %DRB, %ORB, %ASST, %TOV.\n\n4. Configuration Files\nThe amount of filters and text boxes of BueStats is not small, and since the whole purpose of building this program is to automatize processes, configuration files might be used in order to save time. This files are simple .txt files (such as the ones included, i.e. ValoresDefectoORO.txt), where you can set a default configuration and load it in the interface with a simple click; this feature might be useful for coaches that want to analyze their own team every single week. As it can observe, the text template follows this pattern:\nteam=UNICAJA\nseason=2018\ndivision=EBA,DA\nfirstRound=1\nlastRound=18\ntopTeams=MONTETUCCI,FRAMASA,JAEN\nbotTeams=NOVASCHOOL,MARBELLA,INTERIOR\nintervals=7\nplayers=\noutputFolder=/mnt/DATA/FCBScrapping/Reports\n\nBy clicking the Load Configuration button (and making sure the Configuration Folder is properly set), the information in the text file is loaded.\n5. Plotting Interface\n(NEW FEATURES! March 22nd)\nAs you might see, another GUI has been included in the source code (Graphics_GUI.py).\nFollowing the same nomenclature as the one seen in the previous Sections, simple 2D graphics with team logos can be extracted for any desired statistic (in both the X and Y axes), which can be classical ones / advanced / stats of the opponents. In order to do so, just create a folder called \"Images\" inside the existing \"Reports\" one (e.g. mkdir /mnt/DATA/FCBScrapping/Reports/Images) and copy and extract the images of \"Logos.zip\", which include (thanks to FEB and Muevetebasket) all 2019 logos splitted by divisions.\nThen, you just have to choose the desired rounds and statistics, and the plot will be automatically stored in your folder. Moreover, some npy files are also stored automatically to speed up the process. For instance, the first time you want to plot a specific graphic for (eg) 22 rounds, the scraper will browse around FEB website until getting all data; this process might take a while, but by storing these .npy arrays, it will be fully automatic the next time, without having to wait or whatsoever. Note that I included some default NPY files in a zip file (which are the ones corresponding to team data of some of the competitions before the covid-19 interruption - NpysGraphicAux.zip).\n6. Data Ownership\nAll extracted BueStats' data belong to the Spanish Basketball Federation (FEB) and their corresponding boxscores, which are available online only for non-lucrative purposes. Please cite this GitHub or BueStats ifself if you are using this tool for writing scientific publications or sports articles (researchers and journalists).\n7.

On\naverage, most games normally consist of 400 to 460 individual plays (timeouts\nand interruptions are counted as an Offical Play).\nThe tuple returned consists of the away team, home team, and a list of\ndictionaries (each one represents an individual play in the game). You can\nalways read the source code to find out more.\nAlso, the library does have numerous unit tests that you can check out.\nUsage\nUsing the datetime module.\n>>> import datetime\n>>> from espn import get_games\n>>> yesterday = datetime.date.today() - datetime.timedelta(1)\n>>> for game in get_games(yesterday, iterable=True):\n...     print game\n\nAlternatively you can just use a string in YYYYMMDD format.\n>>> yesterday_string = \"20110330\"\n>>> for game in get_games(yesterday_string, iterable=True):\n...     print game\n\nYou don't have to use the iterable=True argument \u2014 a list will be passed\nback to you.\n>>> april_fools_last_year = \"20100401\"\n>>> games = get_games(april_fools_last_year)\n\nYou can also scrape NCAA Men's Basketball games by passing in a\nleague='ncb' argument.\n>>> march_1 = '20110301'\n>>> for ncb_game in get_games(march_1, league='ncb', iterable=True):\n...     print ncb_game\n\nThe daterange function can also come in handy for generating days

The application supports download and upload of .csv files to retrieve that plotted data.\nCurrently 13 different playing areas across 9 different sports are supported: ice hockey (NHL, IIHF), floorball (IFF), handball (IHF), volleyball (NCAA), basketball (NBA, NCAA, WNBA), men's lacrosse (NCAA), women's lacrosse (NCAA), American football (NFL, NCAA), and soccer (NCAA).\n\nThe web application is primarily built using D3.js.\nHow to Use and Additional Information\nFrom the main page, click on the sport/playing area you want. Each option has information about the specifications that describe that particular playing area, and its dimensions, which correspond to the coordinates.\nEvent Details\nBy default, four pieces of information can be specified for each event.\nThe period of the event can be logged through radio buttons.\nThe team can be specified through radio buttons and a text field that allows custom team names to be entered. The first team, which defaults to Home, corresponds to teal dots, and the second team, which defaults to Away, corresponds to orange dots. The legend below the rink clarifies which color corresponds to which team.\nThe player can be specified through a text field. If the player entry is 2 characters or less (for a player number, say), the player will appear on the event dot on the playing area.\nThe type of event can be specified, under Type or Outcome.Additional options can be specified by typing in the dropdown and selecting the new option that appears by clicking or pressing Enter. Each option corresponds to a different dot shape, as indicated by the legend below the rink.\nDetails logged for each event can be customized by clicking on the Customize Details button at the bottom of the details panel. Details can only be customized when there are noevents recorded.\nCustomizing Setup\nClicking the Customize Setup button will bring up a modal with a list of the current details. Drag-and-drop detail names to reorder them. Click on the eye icon to toggle whether it is visible. Click on the trash can icon to delete details. For created details, click on the pencil-in-a-square icon to edit those details. Reordering details changes their position in both the details panel and the table. The X and Y details cannot be hidden or deleted.\nSpecial details can be added, which are details that do not take inputs but are specially calculated. Currently there a 3 types of special details:\n\n2-Location Events: Using the Enable 2-Location Events toggle, the ability to have 2-location events can be enabled. When enabled, X2 and Y2 details are added to the list of details. Like the X and Y details, the X2 and Y2 details cannot be hidden or deleted. When 2-location events are enabled, 2-location events can be plotted by either holding down the SHIFT button and clicking on two points in the playing area or by switching between 1-location and 2-location mode using the toggle above the playing area. This option is incompatible with Heat Map View.\nDistance: For 1-location events, this detail will be the distance between the event and the closest net/hoop/end zone line center/etc. For 2-location events, this detail will be the be the distance between the two indicated locations.\nShot Value (basketball only): This detail is the number of points (2 or 3) a shot from the indicated location would be worth. For 2-location events, it will be the number of points for the second location.\n\nThere are several appearance options, which modify the appearance of the application but do not impact the data tracked. There are currently 3 appearance options:\n\nWidgets per Panel Row: The number of widgets can be changed from its default value of 2 to 1 or 3 by choosing a new value in the dropdown labelled Widgets per Panel Row.\nRows per Table Page: The default number of events per table page can be modified by changing the number in the field labelled Rows Per Table Page. The default number is 10; the number must be an integer between 1 and 999 (inclusive).\nHeat Map View: By toggling on the option labelled Heat Map View, the option for heat maps (2D density plots) view is enabled. This adds a toggle above the playing area that allows switching between the traditional view with event dots and view that shows the location density of events per team (if Team is a current detail). Two checkboxes below the toggle allow hiding and showing the heat map for each team. This option is incompatible with 2-Location Events.\n\nDefault details can be restored by clicking on the Reset to Defaults button.\nDetails configurations can be saved or restored through download/upload. When a detail configuration is downloaded, it stores the current order and visibility of details, as well as any newly created details. Also, currently selected/entered options in the details panel are made the default options when the configuration is uploaded; if a detail is not visible, it preserves its original default value.\nClicking on the Add Details Button allows creation of new details. There are four options for types of new details: radio buttons, text field, dropdown, and time widget. The name of all details must be 1-16 characters.\nRadio buttons are limited to at most 5 options; each option must be between 1-32 characters and all options must be unique. The default value can be selected by checking the appropriate radio button.\nFor a text field, a default value can be entered and can be up to 32 characters.\nFor a dropdown, options are entered in a text area, with each option on a new line. Each option must be between 1-50 characters. The first option is the default selection. Unlike with the Type detail, new options cannot be added from the details panel, though options can still be searched.\nA time widget is a timer you can choose to have count up or countdown. The starting time can be inputted when creating the detail; times must be in the format MM:SS or M:SS, where (M)M is minutes and SS is seconds. When using the time widget in the details panel, the time can be edited any time the time widget is paused. The timer can be paused/started by clicking on the button next to the time.\nPlaying Area\nTo plot events, simply click on the playin area where the event happened. When clicked, a dot will be added of the appropriate color based on team, shape based on type, and text based on player, and a row will be made in the table.\nThe playing area matches the specifications from the governing body as specified on the main page. For all playing areas, the center of the playing area has coordinates (0,0), the positive x-axis is to the right, and the positive y-axis is upward.\nCredit to Bill Tran's guide on creating the NHL rink using TidyVerse for aid in interpreting the rule descriptions for the ice hockey rink and for the hex codes for the colors.\nMassive credit to the sportyR package created by Ross Drucker, using which the American Football fields (NFL and NCAA) were constructed.\nThe playing area size is not pinned to the window size. This allows you to zoom in and place the event exactly where you want it, but does mean the layout can become strange if you change your window size. Refreshing will readjust the size to match the current window size.\nTable\nThe table logs the information for each event, as well as the row number of the event in the table. Events can be highlighted by clicking on the check box for the appropriate row. This will highlight the row in the matching team color, and both enlarge the dot on the rink and move it to the front if it was previously covered by other dots. Multiple events can be highlighted at once. Events can be deleted by clicking on the trash can in the appropriate row. All events can be deleted by clicking on the trash can in the header of the table; a prompt will confirm this choice.\nThe table, by default, shows the last page, which has the last 10 events recorded. Pages can be navigated using the Prev(ious) and Next buttons at the lower-right of the table. The currently shown events and the total number of events recorded can be seen in the bottom-left of the table.\nBy click on the funnel icon in the header of the table, the filters become visible beneath the table headers and apply to the column in question. Multiple filters can be active at once; if there are multiple filters, only events that fit the criteria of all filters are visible. Events are filtered from both the table and playing area - in other words, events that do not fit the filter criteria are not visible as a row in the table or as a dot in the playing area. The form of the filter varies by the detail type:\n\nNumeric/Time (e.g. X, Y, #): Numeric or time details will have a filter that takes a minimum and a maximum value and filters out any events with values for that detail not in the range specified. The range is inclusive of the minimum and maximum. If no value is specified for either the minimum or maximum, it is treated as if there is no limit in that direction. For example, if the minimum is indicated to be 4 and there is no maximum value indicated, only rows with a value of 4 or greater will be visible.\nRadio Buttons/Dropdown (e.g. Period, Team, Type): Radio button and dropdown details will have a filter that takes the form of a dropdown and filters out any events with values not selected in the dropdown. If the dropdown has no selected options, it is as if the filter does not exist. It is possible to select multiple options in the dropdown filter; in this case, events with values corresponding to any currently selected in the dropdown will be visible. For example, if a dropdown filter currently has the values Shot and Goal selected, events with the value Shot OR the value Goal for that detail will be visible.\nText (e.g. Player): Text details will have a filter that is just a text box: any string that contains the string in the text box filter will satisfy the filter. If the string is surrounded in quote marks, double or single, instead only exact matches for the string satisfy the filter. For example, for the filter value hat, both hate and chat will be visible, but for the filter value 'hat' only the value 'hat' will suffice. It is also possible to use regular expressions in the text box filter for more complex text queries.\n\nClicking on the funnel icon will toggle whether the filters are visible. Filters are applied regardless of whether the filters are visible or not; hiding them does not remove all filters. When at least one filter is active and the filters are visible, a small X-in-a-square icon will appear near the funnel icon; clicking this X icon will clear all filters.\nThe number of currently filtered rows is also visible in the bottom left of the table.\nDownload/Upload Table\nThe event table information can be downloaded by pressing the Download button. There is a text-field to customize the name of the file; otherwise, it defaults to the day and time when the web app was opened. Files are in .csv format, using comma separators, with the header row as it appears on the table, excluding #, included in the file. When filters are active, only currently visible events that satisfy the filters are included in the file; this is indicated by the text of the button saying Download Filter rather than just Download.\nTo initialize the table, a .csv file can be uploaded using the Choose File button next to the Upload label. Only .csv files are permitted. The header row must exactly match the header row of the table, excluding #, including order. Any custom shot types will be added in shot order. Custom teams will be added in order as they appear, alternating between the teal and orange team. This means if a shot by the orange team is logged first, when the file is downloaded and later uploaded, the team will be blue, but besides color there is no impact to the web app. When a file is uploaded, any shots previously in the table are erased.\nRunning Locally\nTo run the application locally, any method of running an HTTP server is needed to prevent browser issues with CORS (cross-origin requests - essentially not allowing the JS files to be loaded using the file:// protocol). Some methods include http-server in Node.js, http.server in Python, or even some browser-based options like the Web Server for Chrome extension, but any option will do.\nThen, clone this repository; for most methods, it is sufficient to navigate into the repository folder and run the server, but check the exact way of starting a server for the chosen method. No additional packages need to be installed; additional packages are automatically acquired using CDNs.\n\n\n", "language": "HTML"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBall-Fall-Android-game\nAptoide store link:\nscreenshots:\nTools used:\nContributing\nTeam:\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBall-Fall-Android-game\n\n\nBall Fall is an addictive catch game.

Make sure this is the only cv2 package installed. opencv-python is a different package that does not include support for the trackers. Do not install multiple different opencv packages in the same environment.\npip install opencv-contrib-python\n\nAdditionally access to the YOLO tracker is required but this is already included in the /src/yolo folder. However, you must download the weights for the YOLO model. It can be done as follows:\ncd src/yolo/weights/\nbash download_weights.sh\n\nIf you wish to use the GOTURN tracker instead of the CSRT tracker (we recommend CSRT) you must download the GOTURN model here and place it within the src folder.\nTo run on the A2D dataset, the Release of the dataset itself is also required. It is available here and the unzipped folder entitled Release should be placed in the /a2d directory.\nUsage\nThe main entry point for this project is main.py. To avoid errors, please run it from the src directory.\nThe most basic usage for the project would be to run on a single input video. It can be done as follows:\npython3 main.py --video PATH\n\nWhere PATH is a path to a video file, for example:\npython3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4\n\nAdding the --fast flag only tracks the ball in frames after the first detection.\npython3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4 --fast\n\nAdding the --live flag allows for real-time tracking. Live tracking is only available when used with the --fast flag.\nNote: performance may be vary depending on CPU/GPU.\npython3 main.py --video ../sample_data/lebron_on_court.mp4 --fast --live\n\nTo run A2D add the --a2d flag, and then to specify the number of samples use --a2d_amt. For example:\npython3 main.py --a2d --a2d_amt 5\n\nForward Pass Only\n\nTrack Backwards + Forwards\n\nReferences / Credit\nThis project builds on the work of eriklindernoren's PyTorch Yolo implementation as a base, specifically the pre-trained model.

Make trades, set rosters, draft\nplayers, and try to build the next dynasty, all from within your web browser.\nThe game is implemented entirely in client-side JavaScript, backed by IndexedDB.\nCopyright (C) Jeremy Scheff. All rights reserved.\n\nEmail: commissioner@basketball-gm.com\nWebsite: https://basketball-gm.com/\nDevelopment: https://github.com/dumbmatter/basketball-gm\nDiscussion: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/\n\nBasketball GM is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please\nsee LICENSE.md for details.\nDevelopment Info\nIf you just want to play the game, go to http://basketball-gm.com/.\nInstructions below are for developers who want to run a copy locally so they can\nmake changes to the code.\nIf you want to contribute but get stuck somewhere, please contact me! I'm happy\nto help.\nLicense and Contributor License Agreement\nBasketball GM is NOT open source, but it is also not completely closed. Please\nsee LICENSE.md for details.\nIf you want to contribute code to Basketball GM, you must sign a contributor\nlicense agreement. There are separate forms for individuals and entities (such\nas corporations):\n\nIndividual CLA (this is probably what you want)\nEntity CLA\n\nMake a copy of the form, fill in your information at the bottom, and send an\nemail to commissioner@basketball-gm.com with the subject line, \"Contributor\nLicense Agreement from YOUR_NAME_HERE (GITHUB_USERNAME_HERE)\".\nStep 1 - Installing\nFirst, make sure you're using Node.js v6 or higher, older\nversions probably won't work. Then, all of the tooling used in development can\nbe set up by simply installing npm and running\nnpm install\n\nfrom within this folder.\nStep 2 - Building\nBasketball GM uses Browserify for JS minification and clean-css for\nCSS minification. To build the app along with all its assets, run\nnpm run build\n\nHowever during development, you probably would rather do\nnpm run start-watch\n\nwhich will start the server and watch JS and CSS files for changes and\nrecompile. This simply runs both npm start and npm run watch together, which\nalternatively can be run separately if you wish.\nOpen package.json to see all available scripts.\nStep 3 - Running\nTo run the game locally, you need some way of running a web server to display\nthe content. There are currently two ways to do it. It doesn't matter which\nyou use as long as you can get it to run on your computer.\n1. Node.js (easiest)\nRun\nnpm start\n\nand point your browser to http://localhost:3000/. If you use the command\nnpm run start-watch from above, then running the command npm start is not\nnecessary.\n2. Apache\nThe mod_rewrite rules in .htaccess can be used to make Apache run Basketball\nGM. Everything should work if you point it at the build folder with\nmod_rewrite enabled. That's how it's done on play.basketball-gm.com.\nStep 4 - Testing\nESLint, Flow, and, stylelint are used to enforce some coding standards. To run\nthem on the entire codebase, run\nnpm run lint\n\nIntegration and unit tests are bunched together in the js/test folder.\nCoverage is not great. They can be run from the command line in Karma with\nnpm test\n\nor\nnpm run test-watch\n\nor manually within a web browser by running npm run build-test (or\nnpm run watch-test) and going to http://localhost:3000/test (this might be\nbroken currently).\nCode Overview\nBasketball GM is a single-page app that runs almost entirely client-side by\nstoring data in IndexedDB. The core of the game runs inside a Shared Worker (or\na Web Worker in crappy browsers that don't support Shared Workers), and then\neach open tab runs only UI code that talks to the worker. The UI code is in the\nsrc/js/ui folder and the core game code is in the src/js/worker folder. They\ncommunicate through the toUI and toWorker functions.\nThe UI is built with React and Bootstrap.\nIn the worker, data is ultimately stored in IndexedDB, but for performance and\ncross-browser compatibility reasons, a cache (implemented in\nsrc/js/worker/db/Cache.js) sits on top of the database containing all commonly\naccessed data. The idea is that IndexedDB should only be accessed for uncommon\nsituations, like viewing stats from past seasons. For simulating games and\nviewing current data, only the cache should be necessary.\nThe cache is overly complicated because (1) the values it returns are mutable,\nso you better not mess with them accidentally, and (2) when you do purposely\nmutate a value (like updating a player's stats), you need to remember to always\nwrite it back to the cache manually by calling idb.cache.*.put.\nAlso in the worker, there is a global variable self.bbgm which gives you\naccess to many of the internal functions of Basketball GM from within your\nbrowser.\nGit Workflow\nIf you want to contribute changes back to the project, first create a fork on\nGitHub. Then make your changes in a new branch. Confirm that the tests\n(hopefully including new ones you wrote!) and ESLint all pass. Finally, send me\na pull request.\nIt's also probably a good idea to create an issue on\nGitHub before you start\nworking on something to keep me in the loop.\nLess Important Development Info\nBootstrap\nBasketball GM's layout is currently based on Bootstrap 3.1.1 with the following\noptions:\n\n@font-size-base set to 13px\n\nBasketball stuff\nAbbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.\nFor instance, \"defensive rebounds\" is \"drb\".\nCordova\nThe game runs equally well within a web browser and within Cordova (Android\n4.4+). The codebase is designed to handle both situations (the main difference\nis absolute vs relative paths, governed by window.inCordova in index.html).\nWarning: This hasn't been tested in a while and is probably broken by now.\nThank you BrowserStack\nShout out to BrowserStack for helping with\ncross-browser testing.\n\n\n", "language": "JavaScript"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSportSett:Basketball\nDenormalized Tables\nQuick Start\nDimensions\nPlayoff / Preseason Games\nA Note on Generated Files\nThis is a work in progress\nUML DIagram\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nSportSett:Basketball\nThis resource is designed to allow for research into Natural Language Generation.  In particular, with neural data-to-text approaches although it is not limited to these.  This page will be updated with more detail, as soon as I have time and am able to post examples of other work I am doing with this.  For the moment, see our IntelLanG2020 paper SportSett:Basketball - A robust and maintainabledataset for Natural Language Generation.\nDenormalized Tables\nTo make things easier for people, I have uploaded on Google Drive a SQL script which will add some denormalized tables created from the core tables.  This provides things like:\n\nPer player/team on game/period statistics, with each player/time-period on one row.\nThe same, except for some name information about each row.\n\nOn the statistics tables, each stat has a count, then also a \"_double\" column, which is one if it is \"double digits\", zero otherwise.  There are also columns at the end for whether the player had a \"double-double\" or \"triple-double\" etc.  These columns are included for teams, and per-period data as well, even though it does not always make sense to use it that way.\nThese have not been thoroughly tested yet, and I will at some point release the SQL scripts I used to make these tables.  I know the underlying table structure can seem daunting/obtuse.  It has been designed to allow for multiple sports and leagues whilst maintaining a high level of normalization.  It is like this, because I find it easier to work with, although I acknowledge that not everyone does.  For NLG research I am looking at simpler ways this data can be made available, and these 8 new tables are a first step in that direction.  You should be bale to just run the sql file with the psql command and write these tables atop your existing database.\nQuick Start\nYou will need a working PostgreSQL installation, as well as a working Ruby environment if you want to use the ORM.  I suggest using RVM, you will also need Bundler.  The ORM are written in Ruby Sequel rather than ActiveRecord.  Whilst this is all in a Rails app, there is no front-end implemented, it is just a convenient way for me to create scripts using rake tasks.  Note that this resource is not meant to be efficient.  If you require high data throughput for some reason, you can use the raw SQL.  The Ruby code is meant to provide a simple way to write scripts to export data, this might take an hour or two to run but it is simple to code and the training of models takes way longer than that anyway, so I find it to be acceptable.\nYou will need to set the password etc in config/database.yml\ndevelopment:\n\tadapter: postgresql\n\tdatabase: sport_sett_development\n\tuser: postgres # Also accept 'username' as key, if both are present 'username' is used\n\tpassword: postgrespassword\n\thost: 127.0.0.1 # Optional\n\tport: 5432 # Optional\n\n\nATTENTION!\nThe original SQL file contained a but where the team_in_games.winner column was often wrong.  This was a convenience column, the scores appear to all be correct.  The file has now been updated, using the score fields to derive then correct the winner column.\nThen navigate to root directory of repo, download database archive file, and ensure you have the correct ruby environment set (if using something like RVM).  Large files can be found in Google Drive.\nbundle install\ntar -xvjpf db_after_statistics_2018.sql.tar.bz2\npsql -U postgres -d sport_sett_development < db_after_statistics_2018.sql\n\nYou can now generate output files in the format required for the system of Rebuffel et al..  This takes about 1 hour to run.  The result of the below command has been uploaded to Google Drive if you just want the OpenNMT training data without changing anything.\nrake export:rebuffel\n\nThis will place several files in the ./exported_files directory.  In order to create the partitions from these files as per our paper you need to combine the yearly files.  The yearly files contain data for just one season.\ncd ./exported_files\ncat D1_2014_data.txt D1_2015_data.txt D1_2016_data.txt > D1_training_data.txt\ncat D1_2014_text.txt D1_2015_text.txt D1_2016_text.txt > D1_training_text.txt\ncp D1_2017_data.txt D1_valid_data.txt\ncp D1_2017_text.txt D1_valid_text.txt\ncp D1_2018_data.txt D1_test_data.txt\ncp D1_2018_text.txt D1_test_text.txt\n\nor run\nsh combine.sh\n\nYou can of course combine these in other ways.  This is just the partition scheme we used in our paper.\nDimensions\nPlease see app/models/rebuffel_open_nmt_record.rb for code which creates this data.  If you wanted to change the data for each input sample, this is where you would do it, either by editing this file or creating your own similar class which is used in the rake script.\nNotice how the class names follow the dimensions highlighted in our paper.  The UML diagram shows these relationships.\nWARNING:  There are some issues with the play-by-play statistics.  Sometimes, they do not line up with what is reported in the box score.  I am working on scripts to automatically resolve these, although early investigation suggests there is only about 1 mistake every other game.  A mistake is commonly just one basket being attributed to the wrong player.  You can use the play-by-play, there is a lot of data there, but there are discrepancies.  Given this is such a large dataset, with original data entry likely by humans, it will not be 100% perfect.  My current plan for this is to take the game data, game period data, and play-by-play, then resolve discrepancies automatically where 2/3 of the sources agree on a correct answer, and the error can be resolved a net-zero effect (same team totals, points etc).\nPlayoff / Preseason Games\nWhilst some of these games are in the original Rotowire dataset, they are not yet included here.  The database is designed in such a way that they can be added later.  There are several reasons for not including them yet.  Firstly, it takes time to import this stuff.  Secondly, just doing regular season games makes the machine learning problem simpler (and it is still very, very difficult).  Finally, preseason games are played in all kinds of places, even against teams from different leagues.\nA Note on Generated Files\nSome functions in Ruby such as sort_by are not deterministic beyond their given arguments.  This means that items which are of equal value when sorted are not always presented in the same order (just together).  The code has also been changed slightly to make it simpler (it used to be several different functions doing similar things).  I only mention this here so you know that the dataset generated is not the exact one used in the paper.  This is no bad thing, running on the exact same dataset over and over again is a bad idea.\nThis is a work in progress\nThis is code from an academic research project, trying to get us closer to a sensible data solution in this domain.  It is not finished, it is not a commercial product.  I am happy to answer questions if you are doing research, but please have reasonable expectations.\nUML DIagram\nSome attributes are missing for this and it needs a general update and tidy, but it is mostly right.  You can find all attributes by looking at the SQL tables.  Rails Sequel naming conventions have been followed.\n\n\n\n", "language": "Ruby"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Curiosity\nAdaptive Reinforcement Learning of curious AI basketball agents\nPart 1 - Bayesian Inference and Information Gain\nPart 2 - Neural Network Learning and Optimization\nExtra:\nPart 3 - Curiosity Loop with Adaptive Reinforcement Learning\nThe Curiosity Loop:\nProject Presentation:\nMore Links:\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Curiosity\nAdaptive Reinforcement Learning of curious AI basketball agents\n\nA machine learning project of learning NBA shots success ratio based on  410,000 records of NBA players shots stats.\nThe project implements various ML techniques in order to create a \"Curious\" AI agent, which learns success ratios and implements the knowledge in exploration-exploitaition game simulation enviroment.\nPart 1 - Bayesian Inference and Information Gain\nAfter an EDA stage and preprocessing of shots data into categorical features we implemented a bayesian inference algorithm and evaluated the feature selection with Expected Information Gain criteria.\nPart 2 - Neural Network Learning and Optimization\nManual Neural Network implementation with numpy and SGD method.

The use of jupyter notebooks is encouraged.\nInstallation\npip install PandasBasketball\n\nAfter installation you can then import it to your environment like this:\nfrom PandasBasketball import pandasbasketball as pb\n\nRequirements\nPlease make sure you meet the following rquirements:\n\nPython 3.6+\nrequests\npandas\nBeautiful Soup 4\n\nAll the requirements can easily be met with the installation of the Anaconda distribution.\nUsage\n\ud83c\udfc0 Players\nInside a player's page on the basketball-reference website you can find several tables, and most of these tables can be obtained as a pandas data frame by calling get_player(player, stat). The 'player' refers to the name of the html file used by basketball-reference inside the url, and the 'stat' means the type of table.\nThe currently supported tables are:\n\nPer Game (per_game)\nTotals (totals)\nPer 36 Minutes (per_minute)\nPer 100 Poss (per_poss)\nAdvanced (advanced)\nPlayoffs Per Game (playoffs_per_game)\nPlayoffs Totals (playoffs_totals)\nPlayoffs Per 36 Minutes (playoffs_per_minute)\nPlayoffs Per 100 Poss (playoffs_per_poss)\nPlayoffs Advanced (playoffs_advanced)\n\nThe rest of the tables will come in the future.\nExample\nTo get the 'Per Game' table for LeBron James you would do something like this:\ndf = pb.get_player(\"jamesle01\", \"per_game\")\n\nOptional Arguments\nThe get_player() method supports two optional arguments:\n\nnumeric - returns the data frame with its columns alreay converted to numeric\ns_index - returns the data frame with its column 'Season' as the index\n\nBoth are set to False by deault.\nConsiderations\n\nThe resulting data frame does not include the table's footer.\nThe resulting data frame will have the same column names as the table's header but it will not have a set index. To set the 'Season' column as index set the argument s_index to True.\nThe columns will be of type 'object', so in order to perform arithmetic functions on them you will need to convert them to numeric. You can do something like this:\n\nlbj_pg = pb.get_player(\"jamesle01\", \"per_game\")\nlbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns] = lbj_pg[lbj_pg.columns].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors=\"ignore\")\n\nOr you cant set the optional argument numeric to True.\n\ud83c\udfc0 Player Game Logs\nYou can get all of a player's games in a season by calling get_player_gamelog(player, season). The season argument must be the last year in which the season took place.\nExample\nTo get all of Kawhi Leonard's games during the 2017-2018 season:\ndf = pb.get_player_gamelog(\"leonaka01\", \"2018\")\n\nOptional Arguments\nThe function get_player_gamelog supports one optional argument:\n\nplayoffs - returns only the playoffs games if set to True\n\nSet to False by default.\nConsiderations\n\nThe resulting data frame will use the 'Rk' column as its index\nThe data frame does not include those rows which are just the header again\nIf the player missed a game, the row will be filled with blanks (\"\")\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Last n days\nGet a data frame with all the season's available players stats over the last n days by calling get_n_days(days).\nExample\ndf = pb.get_n_days(10)\n\nOptional arguments\nget_n_days supports one optional argument:\n\nplayer - returns a pandas series with the stats of the specifed player\n\nplayer is set to all by default.\nConsiderations\n\nThe resulting data frame will have the column 'Players' as its index by default\nThe data frame is in descending order by GmSc\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Teams\nYou can call a team's seasons table with get_team(name). The argument name is the team's three-letter abbreviation (e.g. OKC, MAV).\nExample\nTo get OKC's table:\ndf = pb.get_team(\"OKC\")\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 Generate player code\nBaskteball-reference uses a special code to build each player's unique html page. As of now, almost all functions in PandasBasketball expect that code to get the stats for the specified athlete. If you don't want to copy and paste the code from the URL into the function you can try calling pb.generate_code(player).\nNote: this is not fully tested, so it is possible to get an incorrect code.\nExample\nTo get the player code for LeBronJames:\npb.generate_code(\"LeBron James\")\n\nThis will output 'jamesle01'\nUsing it with other functions:\ndf = pb.get_player(pb.generate_code(\"Donovan Mitchell\"), \"per_game\")\n\nFuture\n\nMake this project pip-installable\nAdd support for the rest of tables on a player's page\nImplement function to obtain team stats per season\nImplement function to get the last n days stats\nImplement function to obtain game results by date\n\nContributions & Known Issues\nIf you notice an issue or want to contribute open an issue over at the issues section.\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nthis is a basketball game demo, base on OpenGL for grapic render,\nsome simple AI technology.\nnow this is the first version, it is just an framework,\nlater I will add some funny things.\nProgramming language: C++\nlib file related:\nglu, glut, glui.\nTODO list:\n1 More detailed AI in game, more real than now.\n2 Read some parameters from conf file, this is going to be implemented through Lua.\n3 User control from keyboard, so user can play with computer.\n4 ...\n#snapshot\n\n\n\n", "language": "C++"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup\nR\nData\nTODO\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\n2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup\nData from the 18th tournament of the FIBA Basketball World Cup for men's national basketball teams\nSpanish translation by Julio Spairani\nR\nscrape.R: Code for scraping and cleaning rosters\nscrape-results.R: Code for scraping and cleaning results\nscrape-playerstats.R: Code for scraping and cleaning player stats\n\nheight.R: Height distribution\nheight-dist.R: Height distribution\nage-dist.R: Age distribution\nshooting-stats.R: First round shooting percentages\nteampoints-perc.R: Players with most team points\nteampoints-game.R: Team points in all the games before the final\nData\nFIBA-WBC19-rosters.csv: Rosters scraped from Wikipedia (accessed 2019-08-31)\nFIBA-WBC19-results.csv: Results scraped from Basketball reference (accessed 2019-09-18)\nFIBA-WBC19-totalteamstats.csv: Total team statistics saved as csv from Basketball reference (accessed 2019-09-18)\nFIBA-WBC19-playerstats.csv: Player statistics saved as csv from Basketball reference (accessed 2019-09-18)\nFIBA-WBC19-venues.csv: Venues of the 2019 Tournament\nFIBA-WBC19-history.csv: Winners of previous tournaments\nTODO\ncreate data dictionary\nFigures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "language": "R"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDunkman\nPlay Online\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nDunkman\n\ud83c\udfc0A minigame of slam dunk for TIC-80\nPlay Online\n\nCompo game for Ludum Dare 46: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/dunkman\n\n\n", "language": "MoonScript"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoopr is a place where basketball enthusiasts can find parks and gyms to play the sport they love.

Bots, on the other hand, can do that hard work of finding the information for us.\nWe will read some NBA statistics from Excel sheets in Python using the Openpyxl library. How will we know which statistics to look for and return? Incoming SMS is two players and a type of NBA statistic, and then the outgoing SMS looks up the statistics of the corresponding players.\nData\nThe data we use is about specific NBA players from this past season.\nThere, you can specify which season, season type (playoffs versus regular season), data type (game average versus total for the season), which dates, and more. Fun, right? \nNo Microsoft Excel? No problem! You can copy and paste the data directly into Google Sheets and export it as a .xlsx file. Here is an excerpt from the the Excel sheet (lots more data not shown to the right and below.)\n\nSome statistics above include age, games played, wins, losses, minutes, points, field goal percentage, three-point shot percentage, and more.\nSetup your Developer Environment\nMake sure your Python and Flask development environment is set up, like this. If you don\u2019t have a Twilio number to send and receive SMS messages, let\u2019s do that here.\nOnce your environment is up and running, run the following command in the directory your python file will live in.\n\nBuilding the Flask app\nMake a file called app.py, and import these libraries at the top.\n\nAnd then make our Flask object:\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8932430/27197789-9ad16264-51dd-11e7-8fec-2bf0295342a1.png\nDon't forget to run Ngrok http 5000 in terminal! In your terminal in the same directory, run ngrok http 5000.\n\nNow onto some fun stuff.\nParse the Data with Openpyxl\nOpenpyxl is an open source Python library that reads and writes Microsoft Excel 2010 files.\nThe higher-order function below takes in our entire Excel file of NBA data returns a dictionary of the data in our Excel file. Players are the keys, and the specific statistic data per each player as the values.\n\nThe data structures we use are two separate lists of players and their corresponding statistics we want to search (ie. just games played, wins, losses, minutes, points, field goal percentage, etc.) We then map those statistics to different columns of the Excel sheet, represented by letters, in stat_dict.\nThen, we need to load the Excel file full of data with load_workbook and create a worksheet. More complex apps or data may have different sheets (with NBA data, one could be Regular Season while another could be for the Playoffs.) Since we only have one worksheet, we just want the one at index zero. Then, beginning with the for loop, we loop through each item in our Excel spreadsheet.\nFinally, we loop through our Excel spreadsheet. The \u201cA\u201d column is for players, so each player in the column (and thus the sheet) are added to our list. Then, we loop through the column which is the value of our dictionary of statistics and columns and add each to the separate statistics list.\nSay you want to read from columns. Each column is represented by a letter (that\u2019s why we made the dictionary above, but the dictionary values match the columns in the Excel sheets.) To search multiple columns and just the front row, you could search something like this:\n\nWith our data, this returns the name of the player in the first row (Russell Westbrook) and the statistics from columns D, E, and F (wins, losses, and minutes played.)\nIf you want to access an individual cell, the following code are two different ways to return whatever is in the B column in the second row. (Without using value, you would just get \u201c<Cell u'Sheet1'.B2>\u201d.)\n\n(another way of writing this same line of code is: b2v2 = ws.cell(row=2, column=2))\nWhat does our code do after searching through the cells and rows creating our two distinct lists? These two lists are then zipped together into one dictionary with players as keys and the corresponding statistic numbers as values. This dictionary will be returned in our SendSms() function so we can check if the inputSMS message is in the dictionary (and thus in the Excel sheet.)\nNow, onto the core of the code!\n\nLet\u2019s break this down. First, we get our input SMS and convert it to lowercase so it\u2019s easier to check. Then, we break it up by whitespace and add each piece to a string array. If that array has a length of five (which is what we expect, because input should be two players (first and last names) and a statistic), then we assign variables to the two players and the statistic.\nNext, we call our higher-order function parseDataIntoDict, and use the dictionary it returns to check that the variables are in it. If they are, we check if the data of one player is greater than the other. Depending on that, a different message is returned. If one or both of the players are not in the dictionary, we return an error message.\nLastly, we run our Flask app!\n\nWow! You just used Openpyxl to read an Excel spreadsheet. Isn\u2019t it a very handy tool? Who knew reading and writing an Excel spreadsheet could be done this way?\nSo what\u2019s next? Think of the possibilities! You can use Openpyxl for financial data, for baseball data, etc.\nQuestions? Comments?

We can simply use drag function from the ball to the rim.\nscore 11-20 The rim is moving and has a constant speed. Releasing the ball and set shooting location as an offset of the releasing position by constant pixels.\nscore 21-30 The moving rim speed is quicker than the score 11-20 and has an unstable speed. We cannot use the method in the previous level. By trial and error, I found that we should fix the shooting position to the middle of the screen. The decision making will be made in the releasing position. However, the optimal releasing position is so small, so the ball get shot not very often. I counter this problem by adding a delay when the rim moves to area before the optimal releasing position.\nscore 31-40 The rim is moving around across two axis in a transparent container. By statistic, it move to the middle of the screen very often, so I fixed the shooting position to the frequent passing position. The logic is similar to the score 21-30.\nscore 41-50 Similar to the score 31-40, but with bigger boundary. The logic is being developed.

This package attempts to wrap these endpoints in a clean, well-documented interface.\nteams, err := nbagame.Client.Teams()\nif err != nil {\n  panic(err)\n}\n\nfor _, team := range teams {\n  fmt.Printf(\"%s, %s - %v\\n\", team.Name, team.City, team.Wins)\n}\nDatabase Syncing\nNBAGame is most useful as a means to populate a MySQL database with up-to-date NBA statistics. The nbagame/db/sync package provides a programmatic interface for syncing data. If you don't need the programmatic interface or will be using a language other than go, you can use the command-line tool in the nbagame/cmd package. First, follow the directions in the nbagame/db README to setup your MySQL database and your goose dbconf.yml configuration file. If you have permissions to create new MySQL databases and access them without credentials, you can create the database by running\nmysql -e \"CREATE DATABASE nbagame\"\ngo get bitbucket.org/liamstask/goose/cmd/goose\ngoose up\n\nOnce your database is constructed, go install ./cmd/... to install the command-line utilities.\nTo sync data to the entire database, run the following command:\nnbagamesync -season=\"2015-16\"\nBy default, the command-line tool only loads data from the current season (except for players, which will load all historical players too). If you want to load data from a particular season, add the season flag.\nnbagamesync -season=\"2015-16\"\nIf you don't want to sync everything, specify which entities you want to sync as arguments, ex:\nnbagamesync teams games\n\nOnce you've loaded the data, open a MySQL client and try querying. Here's a sample query that calculates average blocks per game by team.\nSELECT teams.id, teams.name, AVG(stats.blocks) AS avg_blocks_per_game\nFROM teams\nLEFT JOIN team_game_stats ON teams.id = team_game_stats.team_id\nLEFT JOIN stats ON team_game_stats.stats_id = stats.id\nGROUP BY teams.id ORDER BY avg_blocks_per_game DESC;\n\n\n", "language": "Go"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch Madness Algorithm\n1.

You can start to see that certain teams are overvalued in\nthe pool of brackets compared to their projections (ex: Mich St), while others seem to\nbe undervalued in the pool relative to their projection (ex: Villanova).\n3. Optimization\nFinally, you can apply your scoring to get finishes for each bracket in\nthe pool compared to eachother across the simulations. For example, the 2nd bracket generated in the pool of brackets will have different finishes for each simulation, and so by summarizing its finishes I can get its P(90th percentile) or P(95th percentile). Then you can set up an\noptimization to return the optimal bracket(s) for any number of\nspecifications, Ex: Return 1 Bracket to maximize P(90th percentile). 3\nbrackets to maximize P(97th), 1 bracket to maximize points, etc. I can\nalso test out other brackets against the pool of 1000 brackets in order\nto get alternative brackets which may do well but weren\u2019t included in\nthe pool.\nBelow is the bracket which maximized P(90th percentile) for 2018:\nbrackets$Prob90<-apply(brackets[, grepl(\"Percentile\", colnames(brackets)) & !grepl(\"Actual\", colnames(brackets))], 1, function(x) sum(x>=.90)/sims)\nmax(brackets$Prob90) #projected P(90th percentile)\n\n## [1] 0.306\n\nplotBracket(brackets[which.max(brackets$Prob90), 1:63], text.size = .8)\n\n\nbrackets[which.max(brackets$Prob90), c(\"Percentile.Actual\", \"Score.Actual\")]\n\n##     Percentile.Actual Score.Actual\n## 261             0.925         1070\n\nThe bracket ended up getting in the 92.5th percentile (getting the chamption right will usually get you there). I calculated the 92.5 by comparing the bracket's actual score to the actual scores of the brackets in the bracket pool.\nIn conclusion, using this system allows you to optimize the brackets you enter for march\nmadness. With the app or the code you can change the scoring system, pool\nsizes, number of brackets entered, and projection system. Using this system gives you an analytical way to balance expected point maximization\nwith being contrarian.\n\n\n", "language": "R"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketballStats\nBasketball Statistics Demo\nRaw stats are in /data.\n\n\n", "language": "Scala"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketBall\n\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bf4\u660e\n\u5728\u7ebf\u4f53\u9a8c\n\u6e90\u7801\u4f53\u9a8c\n\u51c6\u5907\n\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4ee3\u7801\n\u8fd0\u884c\u6e38\u620f\n\u8fd0\u884c\u5728web\n\u8fd0\u884c\u5728\u5fae\u4fe1\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketBall\nCC\u6e38\u620f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e4b \u70b8\u5f39\u5bf9\u653b\n\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bf4\u660e\n\u8054\u7f51\u6e38\u620f\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f,\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u542f\u591a\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef,\u8be6\u60c5\u89c1\u591a\u5f00\u8bf4\u660e\n\u5728\u7ebf\u4f53\u9a8c\n\u4f53\u9a8c\u5730\u5740 \u4f53\u9a8c\u94fe\u63a5\n\u6e90\u7801\u4f53\u9a8c\n\u51c6\u5907\n\n\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5b89\u88c5cocos creator(v1.8.1\u4ee5\u4e0a,v2.0\u4ee5\u4e0b)(http://www.cocos.com/download)\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0d\u66f4\u65b0\u672c\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u7684matchvs\u63d2\u4ef6,\u5982\u679c\u60f3\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6,\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728cocos creator\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8f7d\u63d2\u4ef6,\n\n\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4ee3\u7801\n\ngit clone https://github.com/matchvs/BasketBall.git\n\u7528cocos creator\u6253\u5f00\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u6587\u4ef6\n\n\u8fd0\u884c\u6e38\u620f\n\u8fd0\u884c\u5728web\n\nIDE\u6253\u5f00\u9879\u76ee\n\u70b9\u51fb\u8fd0\u884c\u6309\u94ae,\u5373\u53ef\u8fd0\u884c\u6e38\u620f\n\u5f00\u59cb\u4f53\u9a8c\u6e38\u620f\n\n\u8fd0\u884c\u5728\u5fae\u4fe1\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\n\n\u5728cocos creator\u6253\u5305\u8f93\u51fa\u5fae\u4fe1\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u9879\u76ee,\u70b9\u51fbcocos creator\u4e0a\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u680f\u4e2d\u7684\u9879\u76ee\n\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u53d1\u5e03\u754c\u9762\u4e2d,\u53d1\u5e03\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3a\"Wechat Game\",\u586b\u5165appid(\u5982\u679c\u662f\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9879\u76ee,\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5fae\u4fe1\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7533\u8bf7).\n\u70b9\u51fb\u6784\u5efa,\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u5e03.\n\u7528\u5fae\u4fe1\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5de5\u5177\u6253\u5f00.\n\u5f00\u59cb\u4f53\u9a8c\u6e38\u620f\n\n\n\n", "language": "JavaScript"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball web app\nTry out the Basketball web app by clicking on the button below:\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFSM\nFeatures\nWatch Games\nSearch Player\nSearch Team\nStandings\nGame Schedule\nStat Leader\nGame Result\nSpecial Features\nNBA Meme\nNBA News\nPlay with it!\nReference\nLicense\nDemo\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 The NBA LINE Bot with 9 features!\n\nWatch NBA games, check the schedule, lookup the stats, search for players by using Daily-NBA.

Nate Silver's website FiveThirthyEight.com does a good job of showing probabilities of any team winning the tournament.\nSo why the beef with Nate, dog?\nMost of his predictions (as well as others') rely heavily on stats like BPI, Power Ratings, and Elo scores which are themselves based mostly on the ranking of the team going into the tournament. These rank-based stats take many names, sometimes it's \"Strength of Schedule\", or \"Opponent Strength\". But those stats skip over the fact that they have not defined what determines highly ranked team to begin with.\n\nSo, models built on this information lean toward picking a winning team based on who is the better seed. You can see this effect based on who FiveThirtyEight has picked to be in the Final Four from the last couple of tournaments:\n|Year|Team|Seed|Made Final Four\n-----|-----|-----|:-----:|-----\n2016|Kansas|1|No\n||UNC|1|Yes\n||Mich. St.|2|No\n||Oklahoma|2|Yes\n2015|Kentucky|1|Yes\n||Villanova|1|No\n||Duke|1|Yes (won championship)\n||Arizona|2|No\n2014|Florida|1|Yes\n||Arizona|1|No\n||Louisville|4|No\n||Mich. St.|4|No\nHmmmm...that seems to be a lot of No.1 seeds. Perhaps they are seeded higher because they are the better team, so we should use this number, right?\nNot exactly, ranking and placing teams in the opening round of the tournament is far more complicated, and even worse, dependent on a panel to decide where each team should rank.\nA Rank Agnostic Approach\nWhy not just ignore the rankings, and mine through historical data to evaluate team performance based solely on player-level data?\nWe can then use this game data to predict the outcome of future matches based on the patterns seen in the historical data. Machine Learning techniques like Neural Nets do a great job of finding these type of patterns. So let's build a Multilayer Perceptron to take player data from regular season game data to predict the margin of victory (the point-spread) of post-season games like the March Madness tournament.\nThis data was scraped for every game that had complete boxscores for the last decade using my scrapey.py file in this repo. Also, csv files for player data of each season are available in the data folder.\nWhat is a point-spread?\nPoint-spreads were introduced by Charles K. McNeil (who later became JFK's math teacher) as an attempt to balance out betting between both outcomes. For example, if Team 1 is a strong favorite to beat Team 2, you would expect that a majority of the bets will be for Team 1 to win. This is a huge disadvantage to whomever is taking the bet. If Team 1 wins, they have a massive amount of payouts to make. But, if we make the bet over whether Team 1 will win by more than an certain number of points rather than just if they will win. We now can move this handicap to persuade bets to take one side or the other and thus keep an even number of bets on both sides.\nWait, why would the people taking the bet want an even number on both sides?\nGreat question, because they want to minimize their exposure to risk. With balanced betting they can trust that regardless of the outcome, there is no risk of one side having to pay out more than the other. Don't worry though, they still get a piece of every bet they see, so they still make money.\nNeural Nets\nNeural Nets (NN) adapt to the data being feed into them. They are adapting to what they see in relation to the desired outcome. This adaptation of the model is why these methods are referred to as Machine Learning. The model changes a neuron's weighted input that minimizes the error between the model output and desired output.\nTo build the Multilayer Perceptron NN I used Keras and followed a lot of what Jason Brownlee blogged about on Machine Learning Mastery. Because we are concerned with predicting point_spreads, this is a regression model. I used a deep network in the hopes that it would allow the NN to find more interactive patterns in the player stats, like an underlying synergy or \"team-i-ness\". I tested just under 100 different parameter tweaks (e.g. number of hidden layers, width of input layer, activation function, and epoch/batch sizes). Using the following model I achieved the lowest RMSE and highest percentange of correct calls on game winner:\ndef baseline_model():\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Dense(200, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',\n        activation='softsign'))\n    model.add(Dense(75, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',\n        activation='softsign'))\n    model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=X2_reg.shape[1], init='uniform',\n        activation='relu'))\n    model.add(Dense(1, init='uniform'))\n\n    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n    return model\n2017 March Madness\nThis same approach was used to model data from the 2016-2017 dataset. Results of all predictions (all 351 tems playing each other, roughly 62,000 predictions) were computed and dumped into a python dict which allows fast access to results without the unnecessary re-modeling and re-predicting. Because dicts are hash-mapped, they are also incredible fast and web-friendly since they resemble JSON elements. These predictions get served over the web using a Flask app which you can find here: SmarterThanNateSilver.com\nAfter \"Selection Sunday\" on March 12th, I will be filling out a bracket with choices made solely by my model, as well as predicted results for daily match-ups throughout the tournament.\nI have also modified this model to conform to Kaggle's \"March Machine Learning Mania\" so you can track how well it's holding up against other Data Science Nerds:\nKaggle Leaderboard\nContact\nFeel free to reach out if you are in the market for a data scientist!\nSteve Iannaccone - Denver, CO\nLinkedIn\nGitHub\n\n\n", "language": "HTML"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nbasketball-object-tracker\nCS 231 Project Winter 2014\nProject to perform single-view 3D reconstruction of basketball scenes\nusing commonly available TV footage of games.\nOur main objective is to identify location of court relative to camera.\nSource code is located in the src directory:\n\nTo get an understanding of how the 4-point selection works, look at\nimage_object.py, which calls most other files.\n(This script can be run without arguments.)\nThe homography estimation is done in homography.py.\n(This script can be run without arguments.)\nFrame extraction is done in extract_frames.py.\n(This script requires arguments, which you can find by running with -h.)\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP+ League LINE Chatbot\nPrerequisite\nDeveloper Side\nEnvironment property\nLINE account (LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN, LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET)\nLocal testing\nHeroku\nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nP+ League LINE Chatbot\n\n\n\nPrerequisite\n\nflask/Python 3.8\nLINE v10.14\nPostgreSQL\n\n\nYou need Github, LINE, Heroku accounts to deploy this bot.\n\nDeveloper Side\nEnvironment property\nFill in the following environment variables:\nLINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=\nLINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=\nDATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres\n\n\nYou need to modify DATABASE_URL as your postgresql settings.\n\nLINE account (LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN, LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET)\n\nGot A LINE Bot API developer account Make sure you already registered, if you need use LINE Bot.\n\n\nGo to LINE Developer Console\n\nClose auto-reply setting on \"Messaging API\" Tab.\nSetup your basic account information.

For example:\nfrom nbapy import game\nimport pandas as pd\n\ngame_id = '0021900017'  # taken from 'https://stats.nba.com/game/0021900017/'\nstats = game.BoxScore(game_id).players_stats()\nprint(stats)\nIf you want to cache results so you don't have to reach the api every time, you can use requests-cache\nfrom nbapy import game\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests_cache\n\nrequests_cache.install_cache('nbapy_cache')\n\ngame_id = '0021900017'\nstats = game.BoxScore(game_id).players_stats()\nprint(stats)\nDocumentation\nA constant work-in-progress, but check them out!\nInstallation\nTo install from pypi:\n$ python -m pip install nbapy\nContributing\n1. Fork the repository and create a feature/bug fix branch\n2. Install development requirements\nYou will to first install poetry if you don't already have it.\n$ python -m pip install poetry\nAfter that, just run poetry install inside of your fork.\n3. Hack away\nCoding conventions\n\nblack for formatting\ngoogle docstrings\nflake8 for linting\nmypy for static typing analysis\nconventional commits for commit style.\nisort for import organization.\n\nWhew, that's a lot, but I'm a big fan of clean code, and I hope you are too! The good news is that if you follow the following advice, you'll find these aren't too hard to manage \ud83d\ude04\nOptional (but recommended)\nnbapy has a pre-commit file that you can install to automatically enforce these conventions prior to committing via a git hook.\nTo install: $ pre-commit install\nYou can also use $ pre-commit run -a to run the checks manually.\nFor commit messages, I recommend using commitizen. It is automatically installed in the dev dependencies, so to commit, you just run cz c and follow the prompts.\nIf you're using pre-commit, and either the black or isort check fails, the good news is it will fix the problems for you. However, it won't continue the commit automatically so that you get a chance to look over the changes. You'll have to re-stage the changes, and then you can run cz c --retry so you don't lose that nice commit message you just wrote.\n4. Create some tests\n5. Make sure everything looks good\n$ pytest --cov*\n$ sphinx-build -n -W -q -b html docs docs/_build/html\n$ pre-commit run -a (if you didn't install the pre-commit git hook)\n* note the first time you run this, it may take a few minutes. However, the requests will cache, and subsequent runs should be much faster.\n6. Submit a pull request\nOther ways to contribute involve submitting any issues or adding some documentation!\nTo-Do\n\nFinish Jupyter Notebook documentation\n\nAuthors\nThis is orginally based off of https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py so a lot of the work was done by those guys.

Pressing on any statistic will increment that statistic for the given player by the correct amount. This window is shown below:\n\n\n\nSome statistics increment several other statistics when they are incremented:\n\nMade FG\nMade 3pt FG\nOREB/DREB\n\nFor example, if a Made 3pt FG is selected, then Points, Made FG, FGA, Made 3pt FG, and 3PA are all incremented as well.\nThe program incorporates several features to make statistical tracking quicker during actual game play. Hotkeys are shown in square brackets for quicker statistic entries and several statistics have built in functionality to avoid redundancy. Made Shots, Missed Shots and Blocks will ask the user if the shot was Assisted, Offensive Rebounded, or Defensive Rebounded respectively.\nFor Example: If the statistic is a missed shot, then the user is asked if the shot was rebounded by a teammate, if that is the case, then the user will be asked who got the reboudn. These windows are shown below:\n\n\n\nDid a team member get the Offensive Rebound?\nWho got the Rebound?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Roster Management window has a bench panel on it, then clicking on one of the players on the bench will open a window that will ask the user to substitute the player that was clicked into the game. The window is shown below:\n\n\n\nUndo Button:\nIf there was a mistake when entering a statistic, it is possible to undo this mistake with the Undo Button. When clicked, a window will open with a bar at the top allowing the user to chose from any period of the game. If that period has not yet started, then those buttons will be disabled. When the desired period button is clicked, a list of buttons will appear each showing the statistics entered in chronological order. Clicking on a statistic will close the window and remove that statistic.

It can be played online here. It was made using the Unity game engine.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is straightforward: two players try to get the ball on the opposition's goal; the winner of the game is the one that reaches the goal limit first (if a limit was set).\nDemo\n\nGame Modes\nThere are three game modes available: football, volley and basket.\nFootball\n\nVolley\n\nThere is a 7 second limit for how long the ball can be in the same area.\nIf the limit is exceeded, the other player scores a point.\nBasket\n\nAbilities\nThe game offers three different abilities:\n\nKick - kick the ball, with a specific power and direction;\n\n\n\nLift - lift the ball (90 degrees angle);\n\n\n\nStop - stop the ball;\n\n\nControls\nBoth the keyboard and the controller are supported, although the controller is recommended way to play. The input used can be changed in the 'Controls' menu.\n\nThe menu can be navigated both with the mouse and the keyboard/controller. The goal limit can be changed selecting the input field and entering the number or using the vertical keys (W,S,up,down,LB).\nAI\nThe player's AI was implemented using the concept of decision trees. But instead of writing the functions and all the ifs/elses needed, it was used a YAML file to specify the tree. This file is then parsed by a Python script, that converts it to C# code. With this, the AI can be written faster (less boilerplate code) and it's easier to understand/manage.\nSpecification\nA specification file has three main fields:\n\ninclude - other specification files to include (relative path);\nexpressions - aliases for expressions to be used in the nodes' specification;\nnodes - specification of the tree:\n\ninfo - what the node does (to serve as documentation);\naction - instructions to be executed before the decision is made (ex: setting variables);\ndecision - logic expression;\nyes - nodes to execute (can be multiple) when the decision is true (or there is no decision);\nno - nodes to execute (can be multiple) when the decision is false.\n\n\n\nThere are two dictionaries that must be provided to the tree:\n\nstate - the state of the game;\ndata - (empty) dictionary to set variables (to be used to pass the result and/or to use internally).\n\nFor example, let's say we want to create an AI that just follows the ball. The state provides us with the ball and the player's position. We could implement this AI like so (this could be simplified even further by having an action like data[\"move\"] = state[\"playerPosX\"] - state[\"ballPosX\"] < 0 ? 1 : -1, it's just a simple illustrative example):\nexpressions:\n    # the expression is not needed, it's used just to make the code more readable\n    left_of_ball: state[\"playerPosX\"] < state[\"ballPosX\"]\n\nnodes:\n    ROOT:\n        info: Is the player to the left of the ball?\n        decision: left_of_ball # or state[\"playerPosX\"] < state[\"ballPosX\"]\n        yes: MOVE_RIGHT; SPRINT\n        no: MOVE_LEFT; SPRINT\n\n    MOVE_LEFT: data[\"move\"] = -1\n    # same as\n    # MOVE_LEFT:\n    #    action: data[\"move\"] = -1\n\n    MOVE_RIGHT: data[\"move\"] = 1\n\n    # the SPRINT node could be a ROOT action, since it's simple and always used\n    SPRINT: data[\"sprint\"] = 1\nThis results in the following tree (using the Assets/Scripts/AI/plot_specification.py script):\n\nTrees Used\nFootball\n\nVolley\n\nBasket\n\nExecution\nThe structure is converted in instructions that adds the nodes to a tree, starting with the leaves and ending with the root. In runtime, the game state is passed to the tree, as well as the data dictionary. The result is provided using the reference to the data.\n\n\n", "language": "C#"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball Game\nUnity3D + PSMove\nSynopsis\nInstallation\nAPI Reference\nContributors\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball Game\nUnity3D + PSMove\n\nSynopsis\nThis is an in-development Basketball game, where the player will be able to play using the Playstation PSMove Controller.\nInstallation\nYou can run this source code by downloading, and opening the main scene on any 5.x + version of the Unity3D engine.\nAPI Reference\nWe are using the libpsmoveapi API and the UniMove Package for Unity.\nContributors\nThis project was created by me, Jonathan Prust Vernizzi and my friends Gustavo Vitorino and Gustavo Mendes.\n\n\n", "language": "C#"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball detection\nEvaluation of the model\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball detection\nAuthors: Micha\u0142 Szachniewicz (szacho), Anna Klimiuk (Stardust87)\nThis project automates the process of extracting a basketball trajectory from a video. It saves results and creates a pretty visualization:\n\n\nThe algorithm used for object detection is YOLO, forked from https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. It has been trained on a custom dataset of privately recorded videos. The whole process is automated and it can handle a directory of videos one by one.\nEvaluation of the model\nThe test set was created from two sceneries. Scenery 0 was present in a training set, but different recordings were used. Scenery 1 was completely new to the model. Every video was split into 4 categories:\n\nin_hands - the ball is in or near the hands of a player\nin_air - the ball was thrown and is in the air until it hits something\nnear_basket - the ball is close to the basket or even going through one (it can be occluded by a rim etc.)\nbouncing - the ball is bouncing on the ground\n\nFurthermore, an additional category custom was added and it consisted of different images from the internet to assure that the model can generalize well.  We evaluated the performance of the model on every scenery and category by intersection over union and distance error between (x_true, y_true) and (x_pred, y_pred) in pixel space.\nFull results are available in the yolo_analysis notebook. In short: predictions are very accurate -- the average error in the distance for unseen scenery was equal to only 1.3px! That is comparable to human error.\nBelow are grouped per scenery and per category boxplots of IoU and distance error on the test set.\n\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Scorekeeper\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny Scorekeeper\nShiny Scorekeeper is a basketball scorekeeper app built with the Shiny web framework for R.

We have players like Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving dominating the 3-point range or like LeBron James and Russell Westbrook who devastate their opponents near the rim.\nBut avid NBA fans know these characteristics out of instinct after watching the NBA for weeks, months, maybe even years. I wanted to find a concrete method of arriving at these conclusions. This led me to create a Python program which analyzes any current NBA player's gameplay to find which areas of the court they have most shooting success and the probability of shooting from certain spots. With this analysis, it can allow coaches and players to know their opponents gameplay and can show them which areas of the court to prioritize their defense.\n\nHow It Works\nUsing datasets from Kaggle (formatted with Pandas), we can use Matplotlib to illustrate our data analysis. This dataset includes every shot taken in the 2016-2017 Regular Season so any player who played a game during this season can be analyzed. By incorporating machine learning through Python's Scikit-Learn (using a K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier) we can also simulate a player's shooting from every position on the court.\nI incorporated multiple methods of analyzing shooting habits so let's take a look!\nStephen Curry Shooting Analysis\n\nLet's start off with the two time MVP from the Golden State Warriors, Stephen Curry. In this plot, the green dots represent scoring shots while the red dots represent missed shots. The black dots represent spots that Curry is most likely to shoot from. The size of the dots represent the relative probability of Curry shooting from that position and the darkness of the dot illustrates his shot accuracy from that spot (with darker shades representing a higher accuracy).\nHowever, the black dots are a bit hard to see because of the green and red dots, so let's simplify the plot.\n\nSo how did we do? Our plot says that Curry is most likely to shoot from very close range (at layup distance) or from the 3-point range. Any NBA fans can verify the accuracy of this prediction since Curry is known for his 3-point shooting and his ability to rush past defenders for layups.\nFor our next analysis let's change things up and take a look at another player - Curry's teammate, Kevin Durant.\nKevin Durant Shooting Analysis\n\nIn this analysis we are incorporating machine learning by using a Decision Tree to simulate Kevin Durant's shooting throughout the court. With this analysis we have a more uniform distribution for our analysis so we can predict how Durant will shoot based on his past shooting habits. In this plot, the green dots represent scoring shots and the red dots represent missed shots.\nFrom this analysis we can determine that Durant is more dominant on the right side of the court (which is the case for right-handed players). He also is predicted to score with high consistency throughout the key and around the 3-point perimeter - another prediction which is confirmed by his known playing style.\nBut we can take this one step further, let's compare Kevin Durant's shooting to the average NBA player.\n\nSimilar to how we simulated Kevin Durant's shooting with machine learning, we can use the data for all NBA players in the 2016-2017 Regular Season to find the shooting habits of the average NBA player. In this plot, green dots represent shots that Durant made but the NBA average player missed (meaning Durant is above average shooting at this positions). In contrast, the red dots represent shots that Durant missed but the average player scored (meaning Durant is below average at these spots). Additionally, the yellow dots represent neutral areas where both Durant and the average player scored or missed.\nFrom the plot, we can see that Durant is above average in the majority of the court. He dominates shooting throughout the key and around the 3-point range - once again aligning with his known game style.\nHow Did We Do?\nOverall, our predictive models can predict NBA players' shooting habits with a high degree of effectiveness as seen from the analysis on Curry and Durant. We can determine exactly which areas a player is above average at shooting and which they are below. We can also predict where they are most likely to shoot from and their accuracy from these positions. With this data, NBA coaches can plan defense strategies with much higher precision.\nTry it out with your favourite NBA players!\n\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrfeb\nInstallation\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nrfeb\nrfeb provides a set of tools for scraping and analyzing basketball data from Spain's FEB leagues.\nInstallation\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"solmos/rfeb\")\nExamples\nlibrary(rfeb)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ngame_ids <- 2010208:2010216\nshots <- extract_shots(game_ids)\nplot_shotchart(shots, color = made) +\n    facet_wrap(~game_id)\n\n\n\n", "language": "R"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nballdontlie-client\nAPI Implementation Status\nInstall\nUsage\nExample with for-await-of\nExample with .next()\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nballdontlie-client\n\n\n\nJavascript client for Balldontlie.\nAPI Docs for this client can be found here.\n\nAPI Implementation Status\n\n\n\nAPI\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nPlayers\n\u2705\n\n\nTeams\n\u2705\n\n\nGames\n\u2705\n\n\nStats\n\u2705\n\n\nSeason Averages\n\u2705\n\n\n\nInstall\nnpm i @jharrilim/balldontlie-client\nUsage\nThis library uses async generators for handling pagination.

There are two essential parts for this program: R(2+1)D Model (Can be any 3D CNN architecture) and the player tracking. The deep learning framework used to train the network was PyTorch and the machine used to train the model was the Nvidia RTX 3060ti GPU.\nThis is a demo video from the SpaceJam Repo.\nDemo Video\nAction/Video Classification\nA pretrained baseline R(2+1)D CNN (pretrained on kinetics-400 dataset) from torchvision.models is used and further fine-tuned on the SpaceJam dataset. Any 3D CNN architecture can be used, but for this project it was decided that the R(2+1)D was a perfect balance in terms of number of parameters and overall model performance. It was also shown in the paper that factorizing 3D convolutional filters into separate spatial and temporal dimensions, alongside residual learning yields significant gains in accuracy. The training was done at train.py.\nDataset\nAs mentioned above, the SpaceJam Basketball Action Dataset was used to train the R(2+1)D CNN model for video/action classification of basketball actions. The Repo contains two datasets (clips->.mp4 files and joints -> .npy files) of basketball single-player actions. The size of the two final annotated datasets is about 32,560 examples. Custom dataloaders were used for the basketball dataset in the dataset.py.\n\nAugmentations\nAfter reading the thesis Classificazione di Azioni Cestistiche mediante Tecniche di Deep Learning, (Written by Simone Francia) it was determined that the poorest classes with examples less than 2000 examples were augmented. Dribble, Ball in Hand, Pass, Block, Pick and Shoot were among the classes that were augmented. Augmentations were applied by running the script augment_videos.py and saved in a given output directory. Translation and Rotation were the only augmentations applied. After applying the augmentations the dataset has 49,901 examples.\nRotate\n\nTranslate\n\nTraining\nThe training was done at train.py. The training was run for 25 epochs and with a batch size of 8. The model was trained with the classic 70/20/10 split. Where 70% of the data was use to train and 20% was used to validate the model. And, the rest of the 10% was used in the inference to test the final model. It was found that a learning rate of 0.0001 was better than a learning rate of 0.001.\nCheckpointing\nBoth history and checkpointing is done after every epoch with checkpoints.py in the utils directory.\nValidation and Evaluation\nThe final model was a R(2+1)D CNN trained on the additional augmented examples. For validation on the test set, the model at epoch 19 was used as it was the best performing model in terms of validation f1-score and accuracy. The model performs significantly better than the reported 73% in the thesis Classificazione di Azioni Cestistiche mediante Tecniche di Deep Learning, acheiving 85% for both validation accuracy and test accuracy. The confusion matrix was attained using the inference.py code. Further analysis on predictions and errors is done on error_analysis.ipynb notebook.\nConfusion Matrix\n- 0: Block, 1: Pass, 2: Run, 3: Dribble, 4: Shoot, 5: Ball in Hand, 6: Defence, 7: Pick, 8: No Action, 9: Walk\nTest on Training and Validation Set\n\nTesting on the 10% of the leftover data.\n\nInference Examples - Error Analysis\n\n\n\nState\nShooting\nDribble\nPass\nDefence\nPick\nRun\nWalk\nBlock\nNo Action\n\n\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Tracking\nAll player tracking is done in main.py. Players are tracked by manually selecting the ROI using the opencv TrackerCSRT_create() tracker. In theory, an unlimited amount of people or players can be tracked, but this will significantly increase the compute time. In the example above only 2 players, LeBron James (Offence) & Deandre Jordan (Defence) were tracked. A simple example of player tracking is available in Basketball-Player-Tracker.\nOutput\nAfter extracting the bounding boxes from TrackerCSRT_create(), a cropped clip of 16 frames is used to classify the actions. The 16 frame length clip is determined by the vid_stride (Set to 8 in the example video above) which is set in the cropWindows() function in main.py. Within the cropped window time frame the action is displayed on top of the bounding boxes to show the action of the tracked player.\nFuture Additions\n\nSeparate augmented examples from validation and only in training.\nUtilize better player tracking methods.\nRestrict Box size to 176x128 (Or with similar Aspect Ratio), so resize of image is not applied.\nFully automate player tracking. Potentially using YOLO or any other Object Detection Models.\nPlay around with hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch size, layers frozen, etc.\nTry various 3D-CNN Architectures or sequential models such as CONV-LSTMs.\nImprove model to +90% accuracy and f1-score.\n\nNote:\n\nThe Model does not perform well with off-ball actions for some reason. Often times, the defender is classified to be dribbling when they are not. This might be because of the similarity of the stance while dribbling the ball and playing defence. For both movements, players generally lower their torsos forward in order to lower their centre of gravity.\n\nCredits\nMajor thanks to Simone Francia for the basketball action dataset and paper on action classification with 3D-CNNs.\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nGBA-Audio-Basketball-Game\nI found a way to play audio clips on the Game Boy Advance.\nThis has several thing to help teach you how to make a simple game.\nCheck out my YouTube channel too! www.youtube.com/c/3dsage\n\n\n", "language": "C"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject: College Basketball Final Four Prediction\nProject Goal\nDataset Information:\nTech Stack\nFeatured ML Algorithms\nThings to Note\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nProject: College Basketball Final Four Prediction\nProject Goal\nAnalyze basketball metrics of different college basketball teams and predict which teams can make it to the NCAA Final Four.\nDataset Information:\nThis dataset is about the performance of basketball teams.

Partial recreation of a BASIC college basketball simulation I wrote in the 1980s. Inspired by discussion about The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences: \"Kobe Bryant shooting a basketball is essentially flipping a coin.\" Given seasons of NBA data, I can model those coin flips.\nThe project reads NBA play-by-play game files and builds a probability distribution. It uses the probability distribution and a model to simulate games. There is also a web app to browse imported data.\nGame simulation is very simple. There is a \"home\" team and a \"visitor\" team, each with exactly equal chances, league-average to make field goals, block shots, etc. There isn't even the concept of players, yet! Even this simulation is interesting: given two perfectly-matched teams, ~10% of games are 20-point blowouts. Maybe there's more than coin-flipping going on? An entire simulated season routinely produces at least one 50-win team and one 33-win team.\nInstall\n\nOn OS X, just run bin/setup\nInstall Ruby, node.js\nPostgres\ngem install bundler\nbundle\ncd web; npm install; npm run dist:dev\n\nTest\nrspec\nSimulate a single game\nrake\nThis Rake task also populates the probability distribution from three sample games in spec/data.\nDevelopment\nrake spec:fast runs all specs, skipping any that rely on the database or web server\nrake import:game imports a single game.

State is described by a small number of attributes (is the ball in play?, which team has the ball?, what period is it?, are free throws pending?). Each state has a set number of valid transitions to other states. Each transition also has a probability.\nTaken together, a game is a chain of game states. This is, more or less, a Markov model and a Markov chain. See Markov below.\nTerminology\nEach game state is a Ruby Possession class. Each transition between Possessions is a Play. A Simulation::Game is a chain of Possessions.\nA Game is a store of immutable Possessions and Plays. Each Play is a state transition that produces a new Possession. A new Possession can only be created by a Play.\nIn state machines, plays could also be considered actions or events. \"Possession\" is  nebulous in common usage. Here, it could also have been called a \"game\" or \"game state\".\nThe probability distribution is the probability that a transition (Play) will occur given a game state (Possession). It could also be called a transition matrix or a conditional probability distribution.\nOnly some transitions are valid from certain states. For example, steals can never occur when free throes are pending. All states are valid from each other. They are all \"accessible\" Markov states.\nIn some places, it is easier to express plays and possessions with symbols. For example: { ball_in_play: true, team: :home } => [ :turnover ] => { ball_in_play: true, team: :visitor }\nRedux\nWhile not strictly a Redux app, the simulation uses the reducer, state, and action ideas from Redux. Possessions are immutable Redux states, Plays are actions, and the GamePlay play! method is a reducer. GamePlay.play!(possession, play) => possession is equivalent to Redux's function(previousState, action) => newState.\nA Play is a record of an \"applied\" action, either from a real-world sample or a simulation. The Play key (:rebound, team: :defense) is the Redux action.\nThis is a handy way to model basketball games that leads to concise, testable model code.\nSystem\nThe larger system accepts play-by-play JSON files as input and outputs Simulation::Game.\nInput: historical state transitions. Output: chain of states\nModules:\n\nSample. Import JSON files from real world games.\nModel. Abstract model of basketball game.\nSimulation. Use probabilities from Sample to run Model to simulation a game or season of games.\nView. Display Simulation output as text.\nWeb. Web UI.\n\nMany modules have duplicate names (Game, Team), but these duplicates are different, though related concepts. Mixing those concepts makes for confusing code.\nStates\nPossessions are game states at a point in time. Game state can be considered essentially infinite. Every combination of players, time remaining, score, fouls, etc. can produce different transition probabilities.\nHowever, to model what is possible is much more finite. The model uses just:\n\nball in play?\nteam has possession?\npending free throws?\npending technical free throws?\n\nTaken in order, the states are exclusive, so game state can be reduced in PlayMatrix to just: technical free throws?, free throws?, team?, ball in play?, any time remaining?.\nGames could be modeled as several concurrent game state machines. One each for possession, FTs, etc., but that isn't helpful in practice.\nSimulation\nThe simulation is inspired by the Monte Carlo method, but isn't really a Monte Carlo simulation. It could be considered a Monte Carlo generator run once. (And could be run multiple times to be a true Monte Carlo simulation).\nThe RandomPlayGenerator is a \"roulette wheel\". The model determines which slots (plays) are on the wheel. Historical sample data determines the width of those slots. Similar to log5.\nMarkov\nMarkov models and chains help build a game model, but they are tools for predicting the probability of future states, not for simulations. This simulation care about the type of transition for counting stats like points, field goals made, assists, and more.\nOur model also has multiple transitions from two states. Typical Markov examples only have one transition between two states, because only the probability matters. Matrices also aren't very useful here, though there are good applications for baseball strategy.\nOld game\nThe old BASIC game had a text box score and a scrolling play-by-log. Similar to what you might hear on the radio or view on nba.com. \"Coaches\" playing the game could sub players in and out, assign position, defensive assignments, and choose basic strategy (offense, defense, rebound, steals, set picks, pass).\nFirst steps on the new simulation are to build a solid game model and feed it good data. With that in place, it should be possible to make a playable simulation.\n\n\n", "language": "Ruby"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball-Analytics\nBackground\nResearch Question\nModel Methodology\nAddtional Functionality\nCodes\nDemo\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball-Analytics\nInvestigated quantitatively the optimal body mechanics for shooting basketball by employing pose estimation and sports theory.\nBackground\nIf there is one thing that I wish I had learned earlier in my ten years of experience in basketball, it is shot mechanics.\nToo often, when training for better performance, beginners put too much emphasis on the drills: \"I should complete 80 behind-the-back dribbles, 100 free throws, 50 three-pointers, etc.\" Focusing on the drills usually means very little attention paid to their body mechanics during the moves. How much should I bend my knees? Should I contract my glute first or quad first?\nAs a wise man once observed, \"form before strength,\" which means one should priortize body mechanics over brute force in most skill-intensive sports.  The attention to details and mind-muscle connection is often what sets professional players apart from street hoopers. But how can we learn from those superstars? What's the secret magic that helps them optimize their forms to achieve longer shooting range and higher explosiveness?\nThough there are rule-of-thumbs about shooting forms, little quantitative work has been done regarding the underlying body mechanics. By employing pose estimation and sports theory, this project aims to unscramble to myth behind optimal shot mechanics in basketball.\nResearch Question\nDifferent key muscle groups are activated at different time intervals when a player shoots.\nWhat's the optimal timing and order for activating these muscle groups?\nModel Methodology\n\nUse the mediapipe API to obtain the locations of each joint (e.g. ankle, knee, hip)\nConnect neighbouring joints to model limbs (e.g. connecting hip and knee gives the line representing thigh)\nCompute the angular acceleration at each joint using the limbs stemming from it (e.g. the rotational movement thigh and lower leg determines the angular acceleration at knee)\nEstimate the activation of a specific muscle group using angular acceleration at the corresponding joint (e.g. glute corresponds to hip). This follows from the angular part of Newton's Second Law (angular acceleration proportional to torque)\n\nAddtional Functionality\n\nProduce a graph describing the player's shot mechanics as muslce activation vs. time\nEvaluate the efficiency of the shot as a score\nGive suggestions on how to improve the shot mechanics\n\nNote: the speed and acceleration are in relative terms, scaled for comparision across players\nCodes\nThe AnalyzerModule.py file wraps an Analyzer class, the instance of which can be used to analyze a video of a player shooting.\nThe pipeline.py file applies Analyzer to produce i) a slow-motion video tracking (at real time) the activation of each muscle groups and ii) a graph illustrating the graph.\nThe Scoring.py file implements a scoring system to evaluate the efficiency of the player's shot mechanics.\nDemo\nSee the Demo folder for demo videos and graphs.\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmateur Basketball Broadcasting Camera System\nFirst software releases as of April 27th 2021\nThe background\nMotion detection\nThe panning (April 29th)\nAsync video capture\nDiscarded ideas\nAsync video writing and others (As of May 4th)\nThings to do (We would love some help here)\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nAmateur Basketball Broadcasting Camera System\n\nFirst software releases as of April 27th 2021\nYou can see the design and consideration in the about section.\nIn this past week, both Sameer and me have found some time to finally work on the coding aspects of the project. In the repository you have both scripts.\nBear in mind this software needs a video recorded with a panoramic camera and some tunning for the specific playground.\nMy script is a refined version of Sameer's, but I have left out by now the recording of the video itself, thus the script is good to play with and see if the algorithmic ideas are right or not.\nThe background\nIn both cases we create a static background by extracting some random frames from the video and averaging them. This system should be improved so it is able to work in a streaming fashion instead of loading from a recorded video. Also, it is hard to get a static image with no players in such facilities, specially if you consider changing lighting conditions and different baskets utilized, so I have discarded such option. This is an area of improvement.\nMotion detection\nMotion detection is done every nth frame by substracting the background image. From there, only bigger than a limit area are considered. To those, the feet position is computed and seen if it is withing the playground area.\nIn the case of Sameer's, the center of gravity is computed just with the center of the feet. In my version, both the position and the area are considered. My alternative makes biggher rectangles weight more in the positioning decision (for example, multiple players detected as just one box, have significant weight as the area is big).\nMy version implements the idea of the Automatic Camera Selection paper.\nIn my version, I believe there is a better way to compute it, working directly with arrays.\nAlso, might be interesting to apply some Non Maximum Substraction (NMS) to reduce false positives, but reality is, as those tend to happen were there are players, I'm not worried by this factor.\nStill, the possibility of shapes entering the field while their feet are outside of it and not being related to the game (like coach or public) is clearly affecting the results if their body is partially boxed. In many cases the bounding box doesn't cover the whole body and it is within the field (for example, the upper torso). It would be very important to reduce this effect to the maximum by proper camera placement (in our lab unfortunately the bodies of the coaches clearly enter the field many times).\nI just purchased a Jetson Nano 2GB Dev Kit. Hope that by using a more advanced motion detection mechanism while still being able to sustain the framerate, will improve this situation.\nThe panning (April 29th)\nI just commited a better panning system solving mostly the jitter in the movement. Now is quite smooth and in case of necessity, jumps forward faster. For sure it could be further improved by someone with PTZ management experience, but for now is ok.\nAsync video capture\nThe last improvement to my version has been to make the reading of the video async. Performance improved from 16 to 24 FPS which is a huge boost. For the background computation I don't use it, but I'm not worried by now about that is it is only computed once in its current form and is outside of the hot code path.\nWhat is more important, the same VidGear library provides methods to read video from a RTSP server (most CCTV cameras have one) and to send the final video to Youtube or Facebook using RTMP (which is the ultimate goal of the project).\nSo not only we have improved performance, but found the way to easily support source and sink video streams !!!\nDiscarded ideas\nOne way to speed up the center of gravity computation was to do it directly over the mask image. It does work, producing good results but surprisingly is slower that finding the contours and iterating over them, thus we discarded it.\nAlso, instead of using an static background image we tried to detect movement by substracting a prior frame.

Team descriptive statistics are,\nfor example, points per game, free throw percentegae, and the number of blocks\nper game. Within this file is a class called 'CBB_Acquire_Team_Data', which\naccepts a span of years and a csv file name as input. This class scrapes the\nsports-reference site for descriptive statistics for every division I college\nbasketball team that played within the span of years input by the user. The\nresults are output to the specified csv file. Each descriptive statistic will be\nused as a feature in a predictive model.\n'cbb_acquire_game_data.py'\nScrapes www.sports-reference.com/cbb for the results of all games played during\nsome span of seasons. The user inputs the starting season, an end season, and a\ncsv file name to a class named 'CBB_Acquire_Scoring_Data'. For every game in the\nspan of season the class will output the two teams playing and points scored by\neach team to the specified csv file. The results are used to form the\nclassification in a predictive model.\n'make_ratings_dict.py'\nUsing the description in http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37, this\npython script calculates several additional team descriptive statistics based on\nthe results from 'cbb_acquire_game_data.py'. Specifically, the statistics output\nby the class 'Strength_of_Sched' summarize the degree of competion faced be each\nteam during a given season. The feature 'strength of schedule' accounts for how\neasy or difficult a team's schedule has been. The feature 'margin' summarizes  a\nteam's margin of victory against all of its opponents. Finally, the feature\n'rating' combines both the margin and strength of schedule of each team to\nproduce a coarse metric that can be used to rank all the teams.

The ultimate result of the\nroutines included in this file is a numpy array containing all the features and\ngame results for the historical game data. The structure 'features.npz' contains\nthis output and is eventually loaded by scikit-learn. The features have not been\nnormalized.\n'make_predictions.py'\nUses scikit-learn and historical game results to make predictions on college\nbasketball games that have not been played. A logistic regression predictive\nmodel is created.

Currently, advanced NBA stats are spread out across various websites such as: ESPN, NBA.com, Basketball Reference and Spotrac. The main issue with the data being spread out is that it makes it especially difficult to scrape and analyze. Our project collects player IDs and puts them in one location. Thus, this will allow us to have all the advanced NBA metrics in one database that is easily accessible. All the data in one place leads to a reduction in the time it takes to scrape it. The new central location of the advanced metrics will allow for basketball statistics to be scraped more easily. Data is up-to-date as of the beginning of the 2019-2020 NBA season.\nTo scrape player data from each key basketball statistics website (https://stats.nba.com/, https://www.basketball-reference.com/, http://www.espn.com/nba/statistics/rpm, https://www.spotrac.com/nba/), we used R packages such as rvest, XML, and RSelenium to gather important information from each site. For each player we scraped their name (according to the site), link, ID (last few characters of link), and birth date (if available) to be able to match tables from different sites. Data was merged by name and birth date, but due to small differences in naming, some merging was done by hand. The corresponding code to scrape each website is provided, so we encourage users to utilize this code to scrape following years of data.\nTo gather the data necessary for identifying each team, we first went to every major basketball statistics website and examined the unique URLs of each team page on their respective websites. Then, we found what parts of the URL make each page unique from each other for the specific websites and logged those changes in excel. For example, the URL for the Los Angeles Clippers on basketball-reference is https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/, while the URL for the Los Angeles Lakers is https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/. We noted the difference at the end of each URL for each team, so that each URL would be accessible when plugging in the different endings, and did this for each website listed.\nVariables\nNBA_Player_IDs.csv\n\nBBRefName \u2013 player name according to Basketball Reference\nBBRefLink \u2013 player link according to Basketball Reference\nBBRefID \u2013 player ID according to Basketball Reference\nBBRefBirthDate \u2013 player birth date according to Basketball Reference\nNBAName \u2013 player name according to NBA\nNBALink \u2013 player link according to NBA\nNBAID \u2013 player ID according to NBA\nNBABirthDate \u2013 player birth date according to NBA\nESPNName \u2013 player name according to ESPN (RPM)\nESPNLink \u2013 player link according to ESPN (RPM)\nESPNID \u2013 player ID according to ESPN (RPM)\nESPNBirthDate \u2013 player birth date according to ESPN (RPM)\nSpotracName \u2013 player name according to Spotrac\nSpotracLink \u2013 player link according to Spotrac\nSpotracID \u2013 player ID according to Spotrac\n\nNBA_Team_IDs.csv\n\nSeason \u2013 first year of season (ex. 2019-2020 season would be 2019)\nLeague\t - NBA or ABA\nBBRef_Team_Name \u2013 team name according to Basketball Reference for given season\nBBRef_Team_Abbreviation \u2013 team abbreviation according to Basketball Reference for given season\nCurrent_BBRef_Team_Name \u2013 current (2019-2020) team name according to Basketball Reference for given season\nCurrent_BBRef_Team_Abbreviation \u2013 current (2019-2020) team abbreviation according to Basketball Reference\nESPN_Current_Link_ID \u2013 current (2019-2020) team link ID according to ESPN\nNBA_Current_Link_ID \u2013 current (2019-2020) team link ID according to NBA\nSpotrac_Current_Link_ID \u2013 current (2019-2020) team link ID according to Spotrac\n\nConclusion\nBy taking note of the differences in how each website identifies players and teams, we were able to effectively bring all of the information from each site into one place.

Our technology of choice has been the Kinect v2 as the Kinect v1 version did not allow for the tracking of as many joints as we needed.\nThe application allows one or two users to compete in a free throw basketball game over who can get more shots into the basket. The application works whether or not there is a second user.The players use their raised left hand to throw the basketball at the correct power level.\nGame code sourced from : https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-basketball-free-throw-game-with-unity--cms-21203\nand : https://github.com/tutsplus/BasketballFreeThrowUnity\nBody Joints List : https://www.codeproject.com/articles/743862/kinect-for-windows-version-body-tracking \nThe UI has multiple elements to help the user:\n\n\nIn the top left there is a camera output that shows what the Kinect can see. We have tried but couldn't get it to output the Skeleton or Joints of the current users.\n\n\nTop Middle \u2013 This is the basketball hoop that the players have to shoot at.\n\n\nBottom left & right \u2013 The user scores are shown as digit values in both corners. They increase when the user gets a basket.\n\n\nBottom middle \u2013 This is the outline of the basketball to imitate the baskebtall being held by the user.\n\n\nBottom left & right of the basketball outline \u2013 These are the power bars. When they start moving the user knows that the Kinect is ready to shoot.\n\n\nInstallation\nTo play the game you will need the Kinect V2 equipment for Windows as well as the Kinect SDK. You Will also need Unity.\n#Project Details\nThere are three gestures in this application both of which imitate an actual throw in basketball:\n\n\nClosed fist \u2013 The user has to start the the game with the fist closed to imitate the holding of a basketball. This is also crucial for the shooting as the Kinect shoots as soon as the hand is opened.\n\n\nArm raised above shoulder \u2013 In order for Kinect to allow the user to shoot, the users arm must be raised above his shoulder. The user can then Move his hand back and forth to adjust the power of the shot. The distance between the hand and shoulder joints is the force that is added to the ball.\n\n\nOpen hand gesture \u2013 Once the user completes the predefined action of raising back the arm he has to shoot by opening the palm of his hand and swinging forward.\n\n\nWe have determined for these to be the most natural actions a person would take during a basketball throw. Apart from the closed fist which was a necessity these imitate the actions taken during a throw.\nA dribbling gesture could also be implemented to allow for the bouncing of the ball from the ground (perhaps with possible sound feedback) but we didn't have enough time to implement it.\n\n\n", "language": "C#"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nBasketball Betting Bot - Another Ball Brother\n\nTELEGRAM: @BasketballBettingBot\nThe fourth Ball Brother didn't make it to the NBA and slipped off into sports\ngambling and wants to play with you!

Top shot-chart match: Rody Gobert\n\n\nWho is most similar to Buddy Hield? Top shot-chart match: Tim Hardaway\n\n\nHow does it work?\nI played around with a lot of different algorithms to define what makes shot charts similar.  It's an interesting question: what does it mean for two shot charts to be similar?\nI made the following assumptions:\n\nIf two shot charts are the exact same, but with different densities, they are still very similar.  Players with different usage rates shouldn't be penalized as being different.\nThe most important features are distance from the hoop, and 2PT vs 3PT shots.  I largely disregard things like which side of the court players shoot from.\n\nUsing these assumptions, I compare the Kullback-Leibler divergence of each players shot distributions.  Players with low KL divergence have high similarity.\nWhat data are used?\nShot data and shot charts are scrapped seperately (design flaw).  These data were scraped March 7 2017, so they contain data from the 2017 season up until this data.\nTo get up-to-date data, rerun scraper/scraper.py and shotchart/shotchart.py.\nTo get historic data, change global parameter YEAR before scraping.\n\n\n", "language": "Python"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwncaahoopR \nInstallation\nFunctions\nScraping Data\nWin-Probability and Game-Flow Charts\nAssist Networks\nShot Charts\nDatasets\nExamples\nCreating a PBP Object\nWin Probability Charts\nGame Flow Chart\nSingle-Game Assist Network\nCircle Assist Networks\nGlossary\n\n\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nwncaahoopR \nwncaahoopR is an R package for working with women's NCAA Basketball play-by-play (and other) data.\nThis package relies heavily on the work done by Luke Benz (lbenz730) in his package ncaahoopR, designed for working with men's NCAA basketball play-by-play data.\nwncaahoopR also scrapes data from ESPN, but differs in that it does not have scraping provided in multiple functions, choosing to only scan in the data once and then makes use of that pbp object within R to produce win-probability and game flow charts, as well as assist networks.\nwncaahoopR is a joint effort between Seth Berry (saberry) and Scott Nestler (snestler).  They welcome bug identification and ideas via the Issues tab, but please look at open issues before creating a new one.\nInstallation\nYou can install wncaahoopR from GitHub with:\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"snestler/wncaahoopR\")\nFunctions\nSeveral functions use ESPN game_ids. You can find the game_id in the URL for the game summary, as shown below in the URL for the summary of the Notre Dame - Michigan game played on Nov. 23, 2019.\n\nScraping Data\n\nget_pbp_game(game_ids):  Get play-by-play data for a specific vector of one or more ESPN game_ids.\nget_pbp_season(team, season): Game entire current season's worth of play-by-play data for a given team and season. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\nget_roster(team, season): Get a particular team's roster, season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\nget_game_ids(team, season): Get a vector of ESPN game_ids for all games in which team plays in. season defaults to current season, but can be specified in \"2019-20\" form.\n\nThe team parameter in the above functions must be a valid team name from the ids dataset built into the package. See the Datasets section below for more details.\nWin-Probability and Game-Flow Charts\nWin Probability Charts\nThere is a function (wp_chart) for plotting win probability charts, using the ggplot2 library. NOTE: This is equivalent to the  (gg_wp_chart) function in ncaahoopR package.  We did not see the need to maintain a base R graphics function.\n\nNOTE 1:  For now, all win probability charts are \"naive,\" in that they do not incorporate a pre-game line or spread, until we determine a reliable and freely available source (since this is not provided on ESPN, like for the mens game).\nNOTE 2:  For now, the WP calculations are based on historical data from NCAA MBB games; this will be updated in a future release.\n\nwp_chart(pbp, home_col, away_col, show_legend = T)\n\npbp Play-by-play (pbp) object created from w_get_pbp_game function.\nhome_col Chart color for home team; defaults to the primary color ine ncaa_colors.\naway_col: Chart color for away team; defaults to the primary color in ncaa_colors.\nshow_gei: Logical, whether or not to show Game Excitement Index on chart.

This includes the appearance of players and the corresponding ones logos. First, the administrator must enter the username and password in the form is requested, after choosing the button \u201cLOGIN AS ADMIN\". The admin account can created by the backend website through it register. It then goes to the \u201cMatches\u201d screen, where there are three columns with the corresponding matches (Previous Matches, Live Matches, Upcoming Matches). From there the administrator can choose a match and edit the tab of. More specifically, by pressing it arrow a popup appears menu, which includes the players of the groups. With the edit button, is transferred to the \u201cWelcome Admin\u201d screen, where it is match management (see R2). \nNote: The edit option concerns ONLY the live and upcoming matches, not the completed.\nR2 \u00a0\u00a0 Match management by Admin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement 2 constitutes the next possibility of the administrator (admin), which includes all functions related to managing a match (Shoot with\ntype and result, Rebound or Assist or Block, Steal, Turnover and Foul). Necessary condition for starting the game, but also to activate the buttons, it is to click the button \"Start\". After it's click, the same button turns into \u201cEnd\u201d, through which the match could be terminated. In addition, the administrator can stop the timer and start it (from where you stopped it) via the \u201cPause\u201d button, the which turns into \u201cContinue\u201d when pressed, and vice versa. Still, for registering any action, it is necessary, the administrator to follow a series of steps. Initially, the administrator during his navigation on this screen, sees the home team selected (by default). To if he can change team, he uses the Banner of which located at the top as an image. Once he selects any from the 2 teams, the key players of the selected team, appear at the bottom of the screen. In the same way that the team is selected, a player can also be selected, that is, by clicking on his image. \nNote: The match does not end when \"Done\" is pressed. Only will paused and the admin will moved back to all matches.\nR3 \u00a0\u00a0 Recording statistics\nThis particular requirement deals with calculating stats for players and the groups, when the administrator performs a corresponding action. These actions include the basic events that occur in a match basketball skills such as free throws and attempts (two-pointers, three-pointers). In addition, assists, rebounds, steals, cuts, fouls are also recorded and mistakes. The specific statistics are recorded in the database at the moment which the administrator presses a similar button from its graphical interface which is fragment_admins_view. Statistics recording can begin the moment a match is live. For something like this to happen, it is necessary o\nadministrator to press the start button from its graphical interface. On the contrary, if the administrator seeks to increase statistics for a player, team respectively buttons will be disabled. Beyond the simple recording of statistics n application modifies the above data into a more logical form for the user. Specifically, in the frontend, a percentage calculation is also carried out through a condition. To if the application succeeds in the specific process, it stores its data in classes statistics for players and teams from the database.\nR4 \u00a0\u00a0 Watch the progress of the Live Match\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of implementing requirement 4 is that users as well as match administrators (admins) can watch the progression of a live match in real time, through verbal descriptions and comments for more details. In order to watch the progress of a live match, one must first choose one, from the list of live matches (Live matches), by clicking anywhere on its layout. Thus, it will be transferred to a new screen, where the 2 teams, the current score, the match week, as well as the current minutes of the match, are shown above. Below, is a menu available where gives the opportunity to watch the match through brief descriptions by selecting the \"Progress\" tab, as well as through comments and more detailed descriptions by pressing the \"Comments\" tab. He can also see the statistics of the teams and the respective players by going to the \"Statistics\" tab (R5). \nAbout the \"Progress\" tab, short descriptions are displayed for actions registered by the admin and performed in the match such as the following: \n\nStart, complete, pause and resume of the match.\nSuccessful freethrow, 2-point and 3-point\nRebound\nSteal\nThe name of the player who made the Assist in parentheses (only for 2 points or 3 points).\nBlock\nFoul\nTurnover\nPlayer Substitution\n\nAbout the \"Comments\" tab, all actions previously mentioned in the \u201cProgress\u201d tab are described in the form of comments with the extra addition of the display of missed free throws, 2-points and 3-points.\nLeft-aligned descriptions refer to the home team, right-aligned to the away team and in the center there are descriptions generally related to the flow of the match without specifically addressing any team.\nNote:  All descriptions are realtime and no refresh is required to display the newest events. Each new action will appear on top, first, at the beginning. Also, the score and the time shown in the header of the match are realtime and directly obey the actions of the admin.\nFor the implementation of the real time data, the possibility of the real time database offered by the Firebase platform was utilized.\nR5 \u00a0\u00a0 Watch the Statistics of the Live Match (Both for Teams and Players)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement 5 will give the opportunity to the user to watch live stats of a match as it is live. The user, having selected a live match, has the possibility to see the relevant statistics of the teams from the last column of the \"Live Game\" screen. Here again the elements on the left side of the screen represent the home team, while the elements on the right represent the away team. In addition, the bars visually show the statistics of the teams by category  (Successful effort, Total effort, Successful freethrow, Total freethrow, Successful twopointer, Total twopointer, Successful threepointer, Total threepointer, Steal,\nAssist, Block, Rebound, Foul, Turnover), while the number above each bar indicates the total number of attempts, successful shots, etc. The \u201cView Players Live Statistics\u201d button at the bottom of the screen, refers the user to the individual player statistics by category again. The team's overall data (e.g. total effort) is displayed on the right and the number representing each player on the left. The bar again indicates the corresponding percentage. Additionally, the user can select the player from the bottom of the screen or change team from the pop-up menu on the top left of the screen.\nNote:  Firebase was used to record and store the data, so that the comments of each match are always updated, without the need for further action by the user (e.g. refreshing the page).\nR6 \u00a0\u00a0 Statistics of completed matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement 6 will offer the user the option to view the stats of a completed match. From the user's home match screen and the \u201cPrevious Matches\u201d column, the user can select a completed match to view its statistics. In more detail, after selecting one, the individual statistics of the five most efficient players of each team are displayed, and below, a list of the leading players in the specific statistics for the selected match. The following are the total statistics of the two teams per category (Team Efficiency, 3 Pointers Made, 2 Pointers Made, Total Freethrows, Team Assists, Total Fouls.\n10). The left side is for the home team, while the right side is for the away team.\nR7 \u00a0\u00a0 League Scoreboard\n\n\n\n\nIn requirement 7, the scores of all the teams will be presented, after they have completed the match in which they are participating. More specifically, the user goes to the scoreboard screen from the \"CHAMPIONSHIP LEADERBOARD\" button located on the home screen. This screen shows the teams sorted according to their score (PTS). To the left of the columns is the position number of each team (#), followed by the team name, total games played so far (GM), wins (W) and losses (L) respectively and finally the points scored have collected (PTS). Points are calculated as the sum of wins times 2 and losses. Additionally, there are two buttons on this screen. The \u201cSTATISTICS\u201d button, which leads to\nteam and player statistics, and the \u201cTOP 5\u201d button, which leads to the best 5 players (regardless of team).\nR8 \u00a0\u00a0 Overall team stats\n\n\n\n\nIn requirement 8, the total statistics of the teams will be displayed. The user from the \"STATISTICS\" button of requirement 7 goes to the \"Championship Statistics\" screen, which has two tabs. The second tab \u201cTEAM STATS\u201d (related to R8), contains four tables per category. In each table the five teams with the highest percentages per category (points per game, assists per game, rebounds per game, blocks per game, up to the given moment in the league) are shown. For example, in \u201cPoints Per Game\u201d, the user can see the top five teams that collected the most points per game.\nR9 \u00a0\u00a0 Personal player stats\n\n\n\n\nIn requirement 9, the personal statistics of the players throughout the league are displayed. The \"STATISTICS\" button of requirement 7 navigates the user to the \"Championship Statistics\" screen, which has two tabs. The first tab on the left (PLAYERS STATS) corresponds to requirement 9 and concerns the statistics of the players by category (points per game, assists per game, rebounds per game, blocks per game, fouls per game), i.e. how many points, rebounds, assists, etc. collected by the respective player per game (up to the given moment in the league). In each category, the 5 players who collected the highest percentages per category, in the matches they have participated in so far, are displayed. These statistics are updated as the match progresses.\nR10 \u00a0\u00a0 Top-5 players for each week\n\n\n\n\nIn requirement 10, the best 5 of the Competition are calculated based on the evaluation system (Efficiency meter). By pressing the button \"TOP 5\" the user enters the page and displays the 5 best players of the matchday (last matchday / current week), according to the position in which they play. For the selection of the top five, the statistics of all players who participated in the completed matches of the current week are gathered, the efficiency index of each player is calculated and then these indices are compared between players of the same position. The player with the greatest efficiency emerges as the best of the week for the position he plays. In addition, the data of the 5 best players is displayed in a frame with a background color that dominates the team they play.\nPrerequisites\n\nAndroid Studio\nXAMPP Control Panel\nAn emulator installed e.g. Nexus 5 API 30, Pixel 3 XL API 29\nInternet Connection\n\nLocal Installation\nFor the correct use of the application, the following actions are required:\nRun at first the back-end:\ngit clone https://github.com/uom-android-team2/WeBall_Statistics-Backend.git or download the zip from github and extract it\nStore or move the root folder WeBall_Statistics-Backend(-master) in <PATH>\\xampp\\htdocs folder\nOpen XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache and MySQL servers\nVisit from your browser http://localhost/WeBall_Statistics-Backend/index/ then register or login and follow the manual\n\nNow, for the Mobile Application:\ngit clone https://github.com/uom-android-team2/WeBall_Statistics.git or download the zip from github and extract it\nStore or move the root folder WeBall_Statistics(-main) in <PATH>\\AndroidStudioProjects\\\nOpen Android Studio and the app root folder.\nConfig the App:\npublic static final String IP = <YOUR_IP>  --> (java/uom/team2/weball_statistics/configuration/Config.java)\n<domain includeSubdomains=\"true\"><YOUR_IP></domain>  --> (res/xml/network_security_config.xml)\nStart any emulator, and then you are ready to launch the app!\n\nNote: Maybe you will see already data for live matches because of the real time cloud service was used, firebase real-time database!\n\n\n", "language": "Java"}, {"readme_txt": "\n\n\n\nREADME.md\n\n\n\n\nThe NCAA simulator application contains the following:\n\nGame simulator built on an individual posession framework (customizable options available)\nSimualted Game Stats (for each simulated Game)\nNCAAA Basketball Team Stats Hub\nIn Development - Upcoming Game Predictions (Vegas Betting Lines Included)\n\nPublished Here: https://tdagostino.shinyapps.io/NCAA-Basketball-Sim/\nGame Simulator:\nAs noted above, the simulator is built on an an individual posession framework using over 35 different team statistics as inputs.

It aims to provide a uniform interface for different datasets, a full\nset of models and evaluation metrics, as well as examples to reproduce (near)\nstate-of-the-art results.\nWe want to thank the authors for providing this tool. This version applies some changes to the original code to specifically adapt it to the DeepSportradar Challenge on Person Re-Identification.\nThis challenge is a fork of the player re-identification challenge proposed in the 2nd VIPriors workshop challenges\n\u00a0\n\nInstallation\nNote that the file setup.py specifies the libraries version to use to run the code.\nInstall PyTorch.\ngit clone https://github.com/DeepSportRadar/player-reidentification-challenge.git\ncd player-reidentification-challenge\npip install -e .\nExample\nRun the following command to train a baseline model:\npython baseline/synergyreid_baseline.py -b 64 -j 2 -a resnet50 --logs-dir logs/synergy-reid/\nData\nPerson re-identification data are provided by Synergy Sports.\nData come from short sequences of basketball games, each sequence is composed by 20 frames.\nFor the test and challenge sets, the query images are persons taken at the first frame, while the gallery images are identities taken from the 2nd to the last frame.\nThe idea behind the baseline is to provide a quick introduction to how to handle the re-id data.\nSpecifically, attention should be put on the dataset creation and the dataloaders.\nThe data files are provided under baseline/data/synergyreid/raw/synergyreid_data.zip.\nThe baseline code extracts the raw files in the same directory and prepares the splits to use for training, test and challenge.\nSpecifically the dataset is divided as:\nSynergyReID dataset loaded\n  subset      | # ids | # images\n  ---------------------------\n  train       |   436 |     8569\n  query test   |    50 |       50\n  gallery test |    50 |      910\n  traintest    |   486 |     9529\n  ---------------------------\n  query challenge  |   468 |      468\n  gallery challenge |  8703 |     8703\nTrain and test identities can be merged (to improve performance) using the flag --combine-traintest.\nThe image filename is divided in three numbers: the first one is the person-id; the second one is the sequence where the image was taken; and the third one is the frame number.\nThe test-set is divided in query and gallery to match the challenge-set format. With the flag --evaluate the distance matrix for the test set is also saved.\nThe identities of the gallery are NOT provided; gallery ids are just random.\nSubmission on EvalAI\nSubmit your result through the challenge page on the EvalAI platform.\nYou need to submit a .csv file as the pairwise distance matrix of size (m+1) x (n+1), where m is the number of query images and n is the number of gallery images.\nThe first row and the first column are the query and gallery ids respectively.\nQuery ids have to be ordered.\nPlease check the example provided in the baseline baseline/synergyreid_baseline.py with the 'write_mat_csv' function.\nPlease refer to the challenge webpage for complete rules, timelines and awards: https://deepsportradar.github.io/challenge.html.\nQuestions and remarks\nIf you have any question or remark regarding the challenge and related materials, please raise a GitHub issue in this
